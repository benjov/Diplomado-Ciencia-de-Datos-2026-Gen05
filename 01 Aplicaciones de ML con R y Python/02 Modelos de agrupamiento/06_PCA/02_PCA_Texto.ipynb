Id been struggling with anxiety before that and was in therapy for that reason. Depression hit me like a brick in the face and I started to share thoughts of suicide to my friends and therapist. I was involuntarily hospitalized after I cut myself in public. From there it stayed bad.While I could avoid the psych ward within the last 9 months except for that one time, I have scars all over my body, especially my leg, from cutting myself. They are itchy, horrible and so fucking ugly.I do not think I have spent a week without an episode in the last 9 months, no week without thoughts about killing myself. I have friends, a therapist, Ill be put on medication. there is a boy and if I can trust him, he likes me just as much as I like him and we may have a future. Things are objectively getting better compared to when all of this started, I was lonely and being emotionally abused by a friend. But I have lost trust in all of this. In my head, I cannot get better. I cannot believe I am loved even though I kind of know I am, logically.I constantly still think of killing myself and today is one of those days. The thoughts do not stop even though life is getting better\",\n          \"Depressed GF (f31) ended things with me (m30) to not put me through it, but I still want to support her. She was warming back up to me again and has since snapped about a job she asked me to do I have a situation that I won\\u2019t go too much detail, but I\\u2019ll probably write a lot about it\\n\\nMy gf/now ex ended things last weekend because of her severe depression after she was crying about everything and didn\\u2019t want to put me through it. She told me she always pushes everyone away. She lost her two year old boy three years ago and never got help to grieve. We also found she miscarried just before the weekend too, however before this she told me she was not wanting the baby.\\n\\nThe day after this happened I shut myself off from my phone and apparently she tried to contact me, raced around to my apartment and was shaking giving me a big hug thinking i\\u2019d done something to myself (wasn\\u2019t my intention).\\n\\nSince then I\\u2019ve felt down about it. I made it clear to her that I want her but I understand that isn\\u2019t important right now and her getting better is key, that I would stick by her no matter what. She appreciated this and said let\\u2019s see what the future holds but that she needs space between us. I agreed and respected this. She also said she still loves me.\\n\\nShe came over a couple of days ago and I was on the phone to customer service. When she spoke to them they asked who she was and she said \\u201chis partner\\u201d which confused me. She invited me to IKEA after I finished work so I could help her with buying stuff, we went and got some food and overall we had a laugh (like our earlier days).\\n\\nI\\u2019m trying to give her space but she keeps contacting me about things in the apartment, etc. Her mum had asked me to reset some laptops for her but I was given no deadline and had been very busy lately.\\n\\nMy ex tried to call me multiple times this morning about the laptops but I was working. I called her on my break and she was very aggressive on the phone. I mentioned doing this as a favour but she called me an \\u201cinconsiderate c*nt\\u201d because of what her mum had done for me. She also complained at me that if it wasn\\u2019t for her nothing would have got done in our apartment and that she was in there today sorting stuff.\\n\\nWhat originally caused her to leave our apartment and go back to her mums were these low moments she\\u2019d have lashing out because of her depression. My issue was i\\u2019d react to it, turn it into something more and walk out the room, so when she was being like this on the phone I wanted to be the opposite and tell her it\\u2019ll be okay and i\\u2019ll sort it. She spiralled into a meltdown with me and hung up.\\n\\nI sent a message after saying it\\u2019ll be sorted tonight and i\\u2019ll drop the laptops off, that I do appreciate everything her and her mum have done.\\n\\nI just don\\u2019t know what to do. I feel like this is a further step back and she now hates me. She seemed to be warming back up to me when we were at IKEA. I still want to be there and support her when she needs me, but I feel like after this, depression aside.. why would she even want to consider making a go of things with someone she sees as \\u201cinconsiderate, dragging feet, etc\\u201d. ?\\n\\nI plan to keep giving her space until she reaches out again, but I keep thinking that in the long term I\\u2019ve severed any chance of her returning. I want to show her I\\u2019m not like that, just I\\u2019ve had to juggle everything so I\\u2019m finding it difficult to complete jobs she wants alongside balancing my own life\\n\\nI want to support her through her depression so much, I love her, but it just feels like she hates me right now\",\n          \"On a scale from 1 to 100, how addicted are you to your phone and/or computer? edit: Wow. So apparently screen addiction is tied in closely.\\n\\n85/100.\\n\\nI've been addicted to any screen I could get my hands on since I was about five.\\n\\nIn middle school and until right now... So, for about 12 years, I've felt like it gives me comfort and keeps me flowing. It never really mattered to me how complex or primitive the device was, I was glued to it.\\n\\nNow, I'm starting to hate it.

Despite financial success, having a few relationships in my life and other qualities that I do not know even count anymore, even with all the therapy in the world, I will never lose the fact that I am weak. I will ALWAYS have an emotional side that is a hair trigger away from engaging at any point in my life, high or low. Emotions, despite whatever women say are fucking kryptonite to women... Our world is so fucked and we are transforming it so that we cowtow to the less than 1%, inclusivity, equality, men are women and women are men but our biology IS our biology. Men are overwhelmingly attracted to women and vice versa and our biology dictates that no matter how much the powers are trying to fuck with the script, gender roles especially, of how we are to societally be or anecdotes that are raised, SECURITY is something that women will be exclusively disproportionate in needing. You cannot have security in a man that is depressed and is not ALWAYS the rock and could potentially break down at something like the irrational thought of his parents dying and not being around even when they are perfectly healthy.Depressed men = emotionally weak men = do not have a 100% ratio of being the rock, the security = that woman, if applicable, runs away to the candy store of infinite options of men, that will run to her with the snap of the finger and she knows this = man, not fulfilling his biological purpose of reproduction and being attractive to the opposite sex, gets severely depressed and either falls under the rug to remain invisible forever or goes into the dirt.We have to remember that men not being open about emotions, is more than likely it not being societally acceptible for him to do so, rather than it just being \\\"Me man, me have no emotion. Me strong\\\". He bottles it and suffers in silence and dies younger. Am I fooling myself in thinking that if I build on all other functions of my life that I will find a woman that will accept depression and weakness or am I doomed to repeat the same sick pattern of women sticking around for a few years and then eventually leaving... *Philosophic thoughts - OPINIONS NEEDED* Is there room for weak men?\",\"Depression\"],[\"Lately life has been fading out like a watery blur.Complete let go, I have been through it so much times...

In middle school he had attacked the school cop, grabbed his gun, and tried to shoot at students leaving a school assembly. Lucky, the cop arrested him. After that, rumors started about me. I had left school for a year to deal with a serve kidney issue. Rumors came that I was in a mental hospital and no one would speak to me. \\n\\nHere is the thing: Both my parents are accomplished attorneys. They were able to have the charges dropped and he was home a year later. He would still hit me, strangle me, stab me. I had to sleep with a knife under my pillow because he would break in and watch me sleep while he spoke to voices in his head. \\n\\nA few years later he almost murderes my mom. He hit my mom with an iron bar over her head, one more hit and she would have been dead. Again, they played their cards and he was home within a year. I would state to my parents about the abuse, how I was scared for my life. \\n\\nThey said I was overacting. Nothing was done to help me.

He was one of the youth group volunteers and therefore, I did not find it odd when he started reaching out to me online. It seemed he was worried about me as an adult and I thought he was trying to sort of guide me into the right path. He would constantly tell me how smart and how beautiful I was. When I was 16 he and I started messaging every day. He would ask about school and ask about my parents. I would complain to him about my parents and instead of giving real advice, he would feed into it. \\\"Yeah, they do not understand you\\\" while making it clear that HE understood me. He made me feel so important and so special. By the time I turned 17 and he was 24, we were in CONSTANT contact. We would message all day while I was at school and then when I got home. I did not do homework and I stayed up til 3 on some nights just chatting with him. When I got my license he began making sexual advances. At first I tried to keep him away but I wanted to be wanted so badly. He told me that we were supposed to be together. He told me he loved me and he told me I was perfect. He would have me tell my parents I was sleeping at a friends house but I would be sleeping at his house instead. One time he convinced me to try alcohol, telling me \\\"It will taste like candy\\\". When I did not like it, he tried to get me to drink the whole things but I would not. He was genuinely obsessed with me. He admitted that he was keeping boys my age away from me whenever he could when I was 15 and 16 years old. He told me that he was always looking at my social media, including what I watched and commented on Youtube. There were a couple times I tried to break things off with him but he just would not let go. This went on and off for 6 years until it finally ended for real. I was 23....and I realized that I was around his age when he started things physically with me as a Jr. in high school. I pictured myself with a high school Jr. of 17 years old and I felt sick to my stomach. It messed me up really badly. I did not know what a healthy relationship was. I never really progressed emotionally the way I was supposed to; like I was constantly just stuck at 17 years old. I wanted him in jail. He BELONGS in jail....only he does not. 34 states the age of consent is 16, including my own. It is LEGAL for an adult of ANY age to have sex with a 16 year old high school SOPHOMOR! In most states, you can even have sex with an actual child...as long as you get married. Guess what? it is LEGAL to marry a child in those same states, as long as you get parental consent; WHICH PARENTS GIVE ALL THE TIME. This is literally happening in the United States and it is just fine with everyone. I am messed up forever, going to trauma therapy, and our government is telling me that nothing bad happened to me. Because at that age I was considered to be equipped to handle a grown man, feeding me alcohol, telling me he was in love with me and promising me that he was going to solve all my problems. The same age girls were all obsessed with Twilight and learning how to drive. I was not old enough to buy cigarettes, or alcohol, or voted....but I could have sex with adults. do not get me wrong; I do not think I SHOULD have been allowed to buy cigarettes or alcohol or vote....but HE should not have been allowed to do the things he did to me.

The transition was especially hard for me because I already had my own tiny studio apartment where I had been living in for three and half years. I knew that moving in would be hard, but it did end up being harder than I expected it to. When my depression would hit when I lived alone, it was easy for me to recluse in my apartment, lay in bed all day and avoid the world as much as I wanted to, but living alone especially during the pandemic was also hard for my mental health. And I knew that moving in with my partner would also have a lot of pros, which still stand today. Its mid July and thankfully that aspect of things have been good. But when my depression hit in February and I moved in with my partner, it was hard for me to hide and recluse myself like I was so used to, so he saw me in one of the most vulnerable and lowest states that I have ever been through. He does not struggle with any mental health issues and did not know just how bad it could get for someone, so he was clueless about how to support me in that state, which made it harder for, because when I am in that state, its hard for me to communicate what it is that I need. He tried and stuck around and is still here with me. I got on medications in May, which have helped. But I still do not feel like myself completely. I work everyday to be more positive because I really do want to turn my life around. But now that I am feeling \\\"better\\\", I feel like I have fallen out of love with my partner. I just do not feel the same towards him and I think he can tell. he is not changed at all towards me, he still desires, supports, and loves me just the same. And I am afraid I will not feel the same for him like I did. Before all this, I saw our lives together and now I do not know what I see. I want to love him and be able to reciprocate all the love he continues to give me everyday, because I honestly do not want anyone else. So what I am wondering is, has anyone else had some type of similar experience? Where you feel like you fell out of love and was able to fell in love again? I am being patient with myself because this illness has not been easy on me and I am making sure to put myself first in terms of also finding the love for myself within.

Went to college, dropped out due to depression and suicidal ideation. 2020 I attempted suicide twice, one by overdose another by fire arm. Started animation school. Got my first apartment.

The problem in having summer vacation, close to no friends and being unable to do your two only hobbies is you have time to think, A LOT of time to think. After about two weeks of doing nothing except of thinking about my past actions and reflecting about my current state of having about 1-2 friends (ig I am still not shure what a friend really is, where do you draw the line?), severly performing under my possibilities and nearly failing my Abitur (Highschool) my mood went downwards fast. After 4 weeks when I finally got my parts to fix the PC the damage was already done. On a daily basis my mood got worse, over time I enjoyed my hobbies less and less, got less talk active (which you can see on this post I usually do a lot) and ate less and less to the point of loosing about 10kg in one week (which is unhealthy but I am overweight so its not that big of a deal) because everything tasted bland anyways and I felt empty anyways. I noticed early where that is going to go but was shure after the last\\u002ffinal school trip in which i had basically a breakdown once a day. I kept going anyways because I did not want anyone to worry but at the same time I wanted exactly that I wanted to see that people actually care about me, not because they had to because they are related or care about everyone, I wanted to see if somebody actually noticed that I am not okay and not just moody. Spoiler: nobody did, apart from maybe my teacher that noticed that i basically went from the most active student in the course to the least active. I cried almost every day. Nobody noticed my mom just thought i wanted to loose weight. My 18th birthday was about that time, I wanted to skip it both my parents (divorced) did not allow it. So i had two partys one with my mom, my aunt and my best friend and one with my dad, gradparents, brother, and my dads patchwork family. Both were stressing me out strongly, all human interaction was hard, I wanted to appear kind of ok even though the suicidal thoughts slowly crawled in my head more and more. I still hoped anybody notices. A few weeks later i was so instable that a simple test in school basically broke me to the point of not even being able to uphold my facade in school. that is where I drew the line, I cannot wait anymore for somebody to help, if I will not help myself now I would possibly do something really stupid later. I went to my doctor. I expected to get told I was overreacting and should calm down. My doctor took me very serious, he calmed me down took some test to check if there was a non hormonal because and prescribed me antidepressants and wrote me sick for the day and tge day after (it was thursday and the second lockdown was the week after anyways). That day was the worst, i basically had to tell my mostly oblivious relatives that I was depressed and i had to decide if I would actually use the drugs I had gotten. After talking with my parents and people I knew I came to the conclusion that I have no real alternativ than taking them. I found a psychologist about 1-2months later way faster than I expected. After about half a year of sucessful medication and therapy my psychologist said they are thinking I would not need therapy anymore, I agreed. I talked to my doctor and quit the meds. I finished school with a grade better than expected. I thought it was over it.But the whole time I knew the only goal I had in finding somebody who cared was unfulfilled. I have not found one person that cared about me, I had to get myself out of there even though that was the only thing i wanted not to do. It haunts me. I had two medium breakdowns this week. I am am fucking scared. I do not want to be depressed again, I cannot go through that shit again. I do not know what to do anymore. Everything turned out fine why am I going down the same fucking road i went about a year ago? Why do I feel like I am not even worth getting cared about? I can study what I want everything went far better than expected why tf is my mood getting worse? I just do not know anymore.

This is going to be very long and I do not expect anyone to read it.&amp;#x200B;what is been weighing heavy on my mind since I woke up this morning is AM. Those are his actual initials and that is really all he is to me. And bad memories. I have nightmares regularly with him in them. I cannot help but want to ask him if he is sorry 2-3 years later. I could not believe my eyes the day I found cp on his second phone. You may ask yourself: \\\"second phone?\\\" then glance up at the red flag. Yeah, I have a hard time not blaming myself for falling in love with someone I can clearly see was a terrible person in hindsight. But I did.I told myself for over a year afterward that I would never be capable of loving someone so endlessly and freely. Part of me still believes that. Part of me knows that is the grooming and abuse still doing its job. However, none of me genuinely feels bad for myself. I wanted to die before I met him and I want to die now. I wanted to die when I was with him, too. A rapper I like said it best \\\"I still want to die, but got someone to do it with.\\\"I think what makes it so difficult is that we were junkies in love. Spending all my money on drugs of choice. Being in love on drugs cannot compare to doing it sober. I still cannot figure out if he knew what he was doing or if he was just so fucked up that he cannot see what he did.For the sake of TLDR, I think the one story I will share is the day he was trying to convince me to give him back his second phone. For context, this was directly prior to the purge on Tumblr. Before the purge in general.I had found cp one time prior around Christmastime living in a motel, but I was so deeply disgusted and disturbed and also (literally) was not trying to invade his privacy, that he easily convinced me it would never happen again and it was a one-time thing that he felt extremely guilty for. I have to excuse myself here and say I was extremely drugged up and not thinking clearly.The next time I found it was after we moved into an apartment and signed a lease. I was looking through his phone and found way more evidence than would have been needed to convict him. I told him and took his phone and almost always kept it on my person. He played nice for a couple days, trying to get me not to go to the police. Which worked. What also worked was the day he blew up. He told me he felt like I was keeping the phone instead of getting rid of it to spite him. I told him I was not sure what I wanted to do yet. He practically begged me to give it back to him. So I took it and threw it into the dumpster in our apartment complex. I told him if he wanted it, he could climb in there and go get it. I am not sure if he did. I would not put it behind him.&amp;#x200B;The other thing weighing heavy on my mind is SW. Also his actual initials. Also only bad memories. Sometimes I have nightmares about him, too. This one is hard because I blame myself entirely for it even though I advocate that teenagers\\u002fchildren are not at fault if an adult takes advantage of them even if they initiate it or think they want it. The age difference was about 10-12 years, but the exact number escapes me. I was a minor at the time.I think he was the first one who ever told me to call him daddy. I do not have any words in my head when I think about what happened, it is really only flashes of what I can remember and what I felt. I feel disgusted by my former self for allowing SW into my home and letting him do those things to me. I remember the smell of cheap beer and menthol cigarettes on his breath. I remember the process of letting him get away even though my mother contacted the police. I remember his girlfriend messaging me on facebook some time later, asking what SW said was wrong with her. That is so sad.&amp;#x200B;What it boils down to is this: after SW, I attempted suicide. I would have succeeded if what I hung myself from did not break. After AM, I never properly attempted, but today I am surprised that my recklessness and inconsideration for my own life did not kill me.Today, I weigh a lot on how easy it would have been to commit suicide after AM. No one cared about me, I did not talk to family or friends, and I had nothing at all going for me in my life.Today, it is only hard to do it because of my responsibilities and shame. there is not much more to say here. Of course, there is also the fact that my boyfriend and family would have to cope with it, but some of that ties into responsibilities instead of actual guilt. It would be easier if I was high and I just want to say fuck it and go buy drugs. But I do not know what my boyfriend would do. Part of me literally does not care because he kind of treats me like shit, too.I literally do not want to put in the effort of getting better. I do not want to have to find a counselor\\u002ftherapist\\u002fpsychiatrist. I do not want to have to try different medications when being high is so much better than being happy. I do not want to talk about what happened to me because there is nothing I can do to make it not happen and because I cannot fucking kill the people who hurt me the most. As far as I know, too, they are fine. they are fucking fine. And I am still struggling to be a person. I just wish there was a switch that could make it better or just never happen in the first place so I did not have to put in the effort to get better for things that were(n't) my fault. I should have killed myself after AM then I would not have to hurt my best friend\\u002fboyfriend and my family I have gotten closer to since I got sober. I wish I never got sober.

Well I spotted one of the foods I really like, hashbrown casserole but that's not really important, and started grabbing myself a decent portion. But with how layered thin it was, to get a reasonable portion, it would take more scoops because of the thinness. Well I guess one of the workers spotted how much was gone from me scooping n they made jokes with one saying \\\"gah damn\\\" when looking over at me and his work buddies laughed. One of the others said \\\"don't worry about it, we're glad u enjoy it\\\" and I usually don't care about jokes like that, but after the day I had, that was the final straw.

I hope you are all stronger than me that is it\",\"Depression\"],[\"Two days ago, I had my first mental breakdown at work because I was blamed for everything for a mistake which in my opinion was not my fault, crying for 15 minutes (at home, homeoffice)Let me summarize what happened. I am a sales (not manager) guy, and I am in charge of pricing and getting orders from my customers and especially maintaining the situation for new\\u002fR&amp;D projects and its sample phases. I have one senior (manager) colleague from purchasing who is in charge of purchase and she is responsible for preparing stock. So we have to (unfortunately) keep in touch and work together as she needs to know the project situation from my customers and prepare stock accordingly.So, in beginning of this year, my customer gave me information of the material list and that SOP is scheduled for November 2021. The lead times for us to prepare is long (40+ weeks), thus my colleague keeps asking me if she should issue orders to our suppliers. As I did not want to go for any risks, I warned my customer about the lead times and said they should release firm orders to us, so I have a commitment and know they will buy the stuff we prepare. My customer kept saying the list is still not finalized but the list would go to the forecast soon and release order soon and they are aware of the lead times. I explained to my colleague to only order if we have something firm and she agrees, and says she would wait until the list of items are in our customer's purchase list\\u002fforecast in their system.Still, in mid of 2021 we still have not received any firm orders and I kept pushing my customer every week. The only reply was, that orders will come soon. Then, last week I received feedback from my customer that the list got smaller and only 4 of the 10 original items are needed (Still no order from customer). At the moment my colleague told our director that we actually already issued order to our supplier (to my surprise) for the 10 items and I am at fault for now having dead stock because I am bad at managing this. Furthermore, She kept asking and harassing me why the customer did not release any orders despite SOP is November. I told her I explained to the customer many times and they said they understand the situation and will wait with the lead time. Furthermore, it is not our fault if the customer does not release orders when we explained them many times the conditions. Well, she did not care or give a fuck.So after that my colleague harassed me for being bad at this job and managing poorly and being fault for having dead stock now (SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASES TO OUR SUPPLIERS!!!!), she of course snitched and complained at out managing director and blamed everything on me. Because I am quite the small fry compared to her in the company hierarchy, the director at first believed only her story and continued criticizing me. Every try of me to explain that I told her to only order when there is commitment from customer, and that we did not know the list of materials was still pending until last week, was seen as a poor excuse. My director looked for reasons to blame me, such as it was also my responsibility to oversee what is ordered and to tell the customer they need to buy our stuff if we already prepare that for them. When I tried to say we should not have ordered at the first place which is her responsibility, I was just shut down.After that I just hoped to die with my 30 years instantly. I was just frustrated of everything and wanted to cease to exist and cried in the corner for 15 minutes.... I think this is what we call power harassment in the office and I guess I was the victim... Never felt so miserable but I think this is unfortunately quite common in work life. I am at this company now for 4 years and I realized the senior purchasing colleague is a bigshot because she is good at maintaining her juniors low and never letting anyone overtake her. She keeps all the difficult work for herself so that no one can replace her. So unfortunately, even if she has problems with some colleagues, she is not easily replaceable.Today my superior helped me and we had a 2 hour meeting with my director explaining what I did for this project since 2020 and made clear that I never supported the idea to order stuff without commitment from customer. Thank god, after that my director believed me and said he will check why our purchasing team ordered the stuff....But still, I still feel miserable for being blamed and that senior colleague from purchasing of mine will for sure continue to do so next time and blame everyone for little mistakes as long as she benefits from that...I used to be such a motivated man when I started working, now I just realize how fuckup this worklife can be....

I feel that Ill never be able to buy a home that is mine, have a savings for emergencies like medical or the vet or a car breakdown and it makes me super depressed, anxious and angry.

I do not agree to meet anyone. Mostly exchanging banter and small talk. Some light flirting.Why do I do it? I do not know. I am not the cheating type. In fact, I got cheated on by an ex-boyfriend, someone I almost married. Multiple times. It pretty much destroyed my ability to trust anyone (until I met my current - and look how I am ruining it now, just before our long-awaited reunion).For the past month or so I have avoided all my friends, except for my best friend - agreed to see her only once. I have only gone out on walks alone, gone to bookshops and coffee shops alone. it is normally what I love, but now I find myself questioning why I do it, why I feel the need to always be alone. Today the answer came to me, all of a sudden. Because when you are alone, no one can ever hurt you. I do not know who hurt me, anyway. But I am starting to realise that I have committed to being alone because - well, I AM alone. I have always been alone.I turn 28 this year, the year that my parents had their first kid. I cannot picture a future that has anyone by my side. there is just nothing there. Every love I have ever had - gone, broke my heart, moved on. Love is so fleeting. what is left but the broken pieces desperately trying to become one again? What can I do to heal but to accept that I can count on no one but myself, in the end?My boyfriend is sweet, and loving, and kind - but I cannot give him a happy and free life, because -I- am not free. he is also so much younger and has so much else to see. he is not going to want me once he grows up a little more. I can only love him in the meantime.I honestly do not know what I am saying. Feels like rambling TBH. All I know is that I cannot think of a single person who is always been -my person-. And that were it not for the fact that I have an 8 year old niece, I might not bother trying to keep living anymore. there is all this emptiness inside that I cannot make any sense of. I am living half of myself - I can never marry a woman - and only now am I realising just how much it is destroying me. Extremely alone and cut off from the world.

After having a very fun depressive few months.. years on and off I really and I mean really want to get rid of this clingy stubborn crap stain of a companion.I have tried doing that by trying to enjoy life more. And you know I am really fucking happy to admit that I think I am almost there. But its like I am sitting on the edge of a cliff and when I look down I can see the type of person I want to be but becoming that person feels like I am going to have to jump off and here is why. I want to be able to wear clothes that look nice and make me feel nice when wearing them. I want to have a better relationship with my parents and sibling. I want to focus on my hobbies like art and writing. Start cooking and doing it more often instead of just eating cup noodles. I want to start enjoying train rides to cities looking at the Opera house at sunset, meeting new people, having lots of plants, doing things that make me feel at peace. man, I just really want to start enjoying life.But every time I do things that I have always wanted to do I remember why I did not do it before and what stopped me. Every time I wear clothes I am excited to wear I keep thinking how bad they look on me. I remember looking through my clothes and putting together outfits I might be able to wear if lockdown gets any better but after every outfit deep down I did not like how my body looked on all of them. I have gained weight and it feels even worse when my mum comments on how fat I look. I am 57 kilos and 163 cm which might be chubby but personally would not go on to say I am fat yeah know? however to my mum, it is beyond every time I come to have a conversation with her, she comments on my weight, my hair, my looks. I remember she used to comment a lot on my grades but after I got A's and made it into a competitive school she stopped and went on other things, the constant shame of grades had driven me into trying so damn hard at school thinking maybe if I get better grades my mum will get off my back. But its as if the more I try to make her proud the more ways she finds to get disappointed. But she is my mum, she is toxic sometimes but I know that she cares and certain times she shows it. but it is hard. it is hard having conversations with my family. There so.... strict and hard to talk to. So judgemental. So overdramatic. Whenever I talk to them I get reminded why I did not. My mum always says I am just avoiding my family I say that I am busy but the truth is I just want to have a nice time with them but I am scared. I am scared that they will say something mean and either ill have to pretend it does not bother me just to maintain, peace or ill let it get to me and get emotional. Whenever I do art, write poems do things that I like I regret doing it because I simply do not have time. I barely have time. School takes up most of my time, it is like I have no free time. Every time I do have free time I study. Study, study, study. Even though I am well aware it will not mean anything to my parents. it is like second nature. I cannot stop thinking about school. I go tutoring in the city, so aesthetic train rides to the city? Yeah reminds me of all the hours I spend on Saturday doing math. it is just that. When I start getting better, all I can see are my flaws. I am emotional, a workaholic, stressed all the damn time, insecure. I get so disappointed, Soon enough before I know it. All the motivation I have to get better disappears. And I am back to square one. I think one of the first steps to getting better is understanding I am very flawed but what after? And how do i get past this? I want to get better for myself, for my mum to stop worrying about me, so i stop getting annoyed at my little brother, being a bother to my friends.

So I decided to book a flight for me and my Fianc down to visit as I have not had the chance to visit in 6 years. The week of the flight all three of my vehicles broke down to where it would cost more to repair them than they were worth, that was not too bad, I had a little money saved up because my fianc and I were trying to save for a house. I figured I would dip into that and replace them when I get back, it was a bummer for sure though. I get down to Florida and my grandma does not even remember who I am which tore me up. I felt so bad because I had not been down to see her in awhile and by the time I did she could not hardly speak and her dreams were more reality than her grandson sitting in front of her. While I was down I figured I would visit my best friend of 15 years and we hung out for awhile and the next day I went to go spend time with my family. My fianc did not want to go so I left her at the house while I was visiting. Turns out my fianc was screwing my best friend while I was visiting my family. I only caught her because I woke up at 3am that night had a bad feeling and looked at her phone.I was devastated and that tore me up bad. I could not believe it. We were together 6 years and I never expected this out of my best friend or her. I was blindsided. Turns out when we gamed on Xbox together they had been chatting for awhile before this and took the opportunity to hook up while I was down to see my dying grandma. Went back home, I tried to mend things but when it was clear she did not want to I did my best to move on. At this point I am back home, sad I just lost my best friend, my fianc, and soon to lose my grandma, and still bummed about my vehicles I did not know what to do. I got super depressed, went drinking with some family, and then decided to do my best to use the pain to better my life. I read two 450 page self help books, I found a better career for myself that pays really well, I started working out and yet, everyday I think about my fianc. I wish I could stop and I hate it and no matter how much I improve my life I am still sad all the time. I just found out about a week ago my x fianc moved down to my x best friend and they got a place and are living together. It basically reset my depression, and then my grandma just passed and I am not sure what to think, feels like I am back at square one. Its been just over 6 months since all this happened to me and I am still broken from it. How long does it take people to heal? This has been pretty traumatic for me. I just want to suck it up and move on. I Had a lot of bad things happen to me recently-ish\",\"Depression\"],[\"#NAME?\",\"Depression\"],[\"21M. So. I have been feeling depressed, very anxious and very low the past while. I grew up in a abusive household until I was 18, I moved in with my sister for 3 years and that turned toxic and it did not work out (she was angry, hatred, thinks she still hates me), I moved into student accommodation yesterday and I am still overwhelmed and depressed. I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry, it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave, but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus, ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions, asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line, but I have dark feelings, I feel hopeless alot, pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it, I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation. I am still very low. But if anyone else is feeling low or suicidal. If this quiet, socially anxious weirdo like me can do it, anyone of you can I rung a support group\",\"Depression\"],[\"Sometimes I get so sad and I do not know what to do. Last night I spent several hours crying intermittently. I have had episodes like this since I was a teen and now I am 40 years old. it is exhausting having to feel all this emotion. At least I am not numb, I guess. But how much more do I have to cry until I am finally done? I feel lost in my life. I am at a point where I need to make some decisions. Where to live, what direction to take my career. (Do I even want a career?) I do not have a partner. I have developed feelings for someone who only wants a casual FWB type involvement. I have gone along with it because I do not have many other options, but it is making me feel bad. I want and think I do deserve more. I am angry at myself for again allowing myself to be taken advantage of by an emotionally unavailable man. I knew exactly what I was getting into, but a part of me foolishly thought he would change his mind at some point and want the kind of relationship I want. So, I feel the need to end that and move on. I am just not made for casual involvements like that. I quit drinking alcohol 73 days ago. I have been completely sober. it is been a positive change but now I am feeling everything without any buffer. I have been in and out of therapy since age 18 or so. I suppose I have learned some things about myself and made some positive changes, but it is done nothing to change the fact that I have the capacity for feeling a deep profound sadness that seems to have no bottom. Maybe it is actually kind of a gift, I am not sure. Maybe life really is very sad. Maybe life is actually just sad\",\"Depression\"],[\"How do you deal with the brain fog that accompanies depression?

I hope you get what I want to say2. Try to love yourself\\u002f appreciate life or what you have I do that everyday. Whenever I see someone in need I help him and I often help people who do not have money, no shelter, not even a family. It makes me realize how lucky I am and on top of that I feel happier (rather than loving someone who does not appreciate you, yes I was once broken by someone, not only once). What you get from these people is love and it makes you feel better.I even played alot with little kids. They give you attention, affection, love and so many things which you do not realize at first sight, but through experience.3.

Think like every human sound is the sound of nails on a chalkboard.I do not have any hobbies. If I do feel like doing something, it most likely is something I can enjoy by myself. I try to avoid social interactions as much as possible.Due to the pandemic, I was able to move back with my parents and work from home. I live in another town a few kilometers away from work and I can save more money for investments, but I have no social life at all. The relation with my family is null. Just the bare minimum and the essentials. No love or emotions allowed.Just as I move everything from my house and finally move in with my parents, my coworkers decide to start hanging out regularly. They meet at bars and have a drink or two. I should not really care about this, but it has really affected me.Is it a hard coincidence from life? One of those motherfucking facts of life? Or were they always waiting for me to move away?In any case, my emotions right now would not have been different. I feel betrayed, even if I should not feel like so.The coworkers are young like myself, and while I am above them in the ladder, I always saw them as my equals. I spent many hours helping them, educating them on work topics they did not feel comfortable enough.One of them is a girl I have some feelings for, but she does not have the same back. However, she wants to stay friends. She noticed that I am not feeling well, since we do not talk as much through text chats on the phone.I may have ruined the \\\"perfect image\\\" I am always showing to the rest of the world, and to her as well. If there ever was a chance that me and her would hook up or something, I do not think that is possible anymore.One side of me wants to give them another chance, maybe if I ask, we can all meet and drink, and share nice stories! Maybe I can rebuild the chat I had with this girl, and who knows what could happen.The other side of me wants to destroy this relation, never come back to the office, never chat with them again, break my promises with this girl, and escape as soon as possible.If you think this sounds very childish, it is because I never developed how to control my emotions. I am very sensitive to things that people say or think about me. My emotions are stuck in pre-teen mode.I do not know what is this feeling I have right now. They are all negative. I feel betrayed, angry, in despair, saddened. For the first time in a long time, I have been just lying in bed doing nothing.From this little slip in my emotions, I can turn self destructive, and the short or long relations I have had, destroy them. Which in turn, gradually transforms the slip into a downfall. But hey, it is not all that bad. In a few months, once the pandemic calms down and I am fully vaccinated, I will be able to go to Europe.I have told my bosses about my idea, and they are in support, and even offered me the chance to work remotely from there. Get some money on the side while I find a more suitable work option. it is all going to be all right, correct? Except, the same things that happen to me here in my country, have happened in the previous times in Europe, and will absolutely happen again. The exact same things I wrote above, happened in my country all through my childhood and further. It happened on my first trip to Europe. It happened when I returned. It happened when I went back to Europe, and now, it happened again.When do this shit change? Hahaha Just got to survive for a couple more months, and everything will be all right.... correct? When do this shit change?\",\"Depression\"],[\"The last 2 months have been extremely bad in my life, and frankly I have talked myself out of just ending it more than a couple of times.

Left behind by people who said they would always be there, until it wasn’t convenient anymore. Broke, ugly, tired and burnt out on this life.

But I never asked for this life in the first place. I wish I could go back now, to that moment I was about to be born and press a button to cancel my life before it started.

Sucker for pain.\",\"Depression\"],[\"I have noticed that talking about my depression and anxiety does not really give me the greatest results. This especially holds true in romantic relationships. I have told just about every woman I have dated I have struggled with mental health and all of those relationships ended. I told them partly because it was all that was on my mind, partly because I wanted comfort, but also a part of me thought I should be honest and transparent about it and that somehow it would be appreciated. I think I have bought into this notion that men should be more vulnerable and talk about their feelings. For a while I legitimately thought whining about my feelings was the right thing to do, despite how dumb that may sound, because no one told me otherwise. I also reasoned that If a woman talked to me about her mental health struggles, that should be an invitation to talk about mine. I had a mental breakdown in front of my current girlfriend. Things are fine now but she told me she does not want me to constantly talk about my anxiety because she also has anxiety and it stresses her out. A few years ago I would have gotten really mad and upset, but I can now understand why that would not be something that a woman would want me to talk about all the time. I said okay that makes sense, and we moved on from there. I genuinely appreciated the feedback, because it was information that was helpful and would allow me to course correct my behavior. After that interaction there was a rough patch but things seem fine now. Every interaction I have had with her since then I have made it a point to be more confident and I sense that she is more attracted to me because of it. I really aspire to not bring up my anxiety and depression to her anymore. I will say one caveat though, if something catastrophic happens Ill talk about it. Some people may say I should just find another woman who understands, but I do not really think a lot of women out there want that out of a man. If I stormed away from her and found someone else to whine to, the same thing might happen. It might even be worse. I think she cares but she does not want to play the role of a therapist.Anyway, I have been reading a lot about personality traits, and the one trait that is not helpful in any situation is neuroticism. All the literature says people who have this trait struggle immensely in romantic relationships, and I believe this would explain my prior struggles. Disconcertingly, its been said that it is almost impossible to change your personality traits, but I am trying to implement tactics that will at least help and I do believe I have made significant progress over the past few years. I just have a long way to go. The thing is, I want to be in a stable romantic relationship, and I am to the point where I would rather just hide my neuroticism and act like a manly, confident man, than allow my neurotic tendencies to be integrated into my interactions with my girlfriend. On the surface this may seem dishonest, but I truly believe the one thing that is causing me trouble in relationships is my neuroticism. If I can keep that at bay while continuing to work on improving by myself, that is what I intend to do. I really do not but this vulnerability crap anymore. I just do not believe women are attracted to it. Maybe if its done tactfully its okay, but when you are at a really low spot its very difficult to do that. I really think my only solution towards a long term relationship is to suck it up and be a man. I know this sounds inauthentic but I really do not want to be an old lonely guy in my 60s or 70s with no wife, kids, or family. If displaying my neuroticism leads to that outcome, I will gladly suppress it all day long. On a side note, I believe that the fact that I can avoid showing my neuroticism is an indication that I am improving. In the past I would not have been able to hide it no matter hard I would try. I am absolutely committed to doing everything I can to improve my mental health from here on out, despite how insurmountable it may look. TL;DR I am willing to hide my mental health issues in order to have a relationship.

Sorry for rambling I do not even know what the fuck I am doing I feel like I am already dead\",\"Depression\"],[\"And has life gotten better?&amp;#x200B;No. Everything is worse.I had some depressive bouts leading up to 21 over how much I was missing out on things that would make me happy. I had never had a date, let alone a relationship, never drank or went to parties and had wild fun like the other people my age I was too meek and scared of everything and despite constant jobhunting, my age and inexperience only ever got me a part time job cleaning public toilets, which did not help as I already felt gross. I disliked myself quite a lot, as I was overweight, short, unhygienic, unattractive, and I acted goofy, childish, loud and overly sensitive. But I can say that I was a hopeful optimist. I still kind of liked myself; I believed I was a good person with a good mind, worthy of love and acknowledgement, and had dreams of working in my creative talents with my then-friends, falling in love, and generally never wanted much like a ton of money or any unique opportunities, just the average house and family life that everyone tends to get, which has always been my focus. And it seems easy enough for everyone else to get, right?I tried. I mean, I really did try, for a decade. I jobsearched like crazy for years while bouncing around my familys homes, doing unpaid work experience after unpaid work experience just to have enough skills to actually be employable, for something other than needing a friend of a parent to put a good word in for me to even qualify as a toilet cleaner. When my dad said he was moving away to live with his new family he invited me to come, but I was 25 and already felt like a leeching loser, so lived off beans and boiled potatoes just to afford a spare room in a house share enough to be out of his way. I got into being more healthy and lost 55lbs during that time, cleaned up my hygiene and nutrition. It stuck, and I now go months without eating any sugar, learnt to cook well, and exercise every day. I went back to university to meet new people, as all my friends had drifted off in life or abandoned me altogether, and I also still had not had a relationship, so thought it would be a great way to meet likeminded people; adult connections that stick around and are mutual, as opposed to the ones Id made in childhood that had drifted off around 21. It was draining, but I did manage to graduate. Trying to study, work, look after myself and meet people was hard to do all at once because I never really was good at growing up Id had a 4 year agoraphobic stint in my teens that had given me anxiety and really damaged my ability to socialise or develop like a normal person, I have been unable to relax in normal situations or properly approach mandatory experiences of growing up like other people do. I was trying really hard to push through it though. I really did try.And what did I get for trying?I managed to upgrade my part-time minimum wage toilet cleaning job to a part-time minimum wage retail job, and have been stuck there for 5 years. I cannot advance in it because my completely broken social skills and introversion makes me really awful at customer service. And because my degree was creative where employability is based off contacts, privilege and experience, I am still no more employable or liable for better work than I was before university, I just have more debt to pay back. I went to study film, which has always been something I have loved probably the only thing in life I have ever felt *in* love with. After college, which ended when I was 20, I felt a bit like the magic had gone, because I saw behind the curtain which took a bit of the magic away, but was still interested in a career in it. Now after university, at 29, I despise it. I have no interest in working in film. 90% of my hobbies were creative based, and I do not even have any creative ideas anymore. I carried this internal sense of imagination and a case of maladaptive daydreaming with me for so long in my life that it was a huge part of me, but now all creativity is drained and I do not know who to be without it. My head is so out of it, I can barely register and react to things that happen in the *real* world anymore, let alone create complex things in my head. Sometimes I react late to conversations *I am in the middle of.* My cognitive function has crashed and I do not even think I could handle a harder job than retail now. But film was a secondary reason to study, I went to uni to open up socially and actually feel like part of the human race again. And did I? No. I did not have a single date, a single relationship, I did not make a single close friendship or helpful connection, because I am awful and broken and not likeable, interesting or attractive enough for people to want to put effort in for or stick around with anyway. My social skills are actually worse, because my mental health problems and self-image are worse. The idea of love and relationships have always been a huge trigger for my anxiety, probably because I wanted it so much (having a family was basically my biggest life dream), but my self-esteem is so non-existent that my philosophy now is, if I like someone, they are already too good for me. And now its pretty much impossible because I have come to find people so insanely confusing and unrelatable and I have not found anyone that comes close to otherwise in over a decade. At least at 21, I kind of understood the generation I was around, but the world seems so scary and aggravating and confusing now, I do not know how I am supposed to relate to any of the younger people I am around who want to follow each others social media accounts or talk in memes, when I am older and just want to have real conversations. How the fuck do university students manage to get into so many relationships when they just seem to talk about weird shit they saw online and the sesh? I do not understand people anymore, and my odds of finding a new best friend or a relationship have plummeted to non-existent as a result. I have not been really timid and untrying throughout this time either. I genuinely got involved, put myself out there, engaged in conversations despite being a massive introvert, even arranged some days out, started drinking and went to a few parties, and tried my best to be human. But apparently people did not find the attempt good enough. No-one has ever shown an interest in wanting a connection with me. Th biggest change in life I got out of university was getting wasted for the first time, but that has now evolved into me just wanting to drink all the time, despite the fact that drinking only every makes me cry anymore, I still just want to do it every night. I do not because I had an alcoholic mum growing up, and I also still try to tell myself I want to focus on being healthy and nutritional. And especially mental health-wise, people say that stuff helps. But does it? No. that is bullshit. I do not eat anything that is not nutritionally beneficial, I get so many vitamins a day and only eat fresh meat and veg. And yet, I am still tired and sad all the time, and most of my joints and bones constantly crack and hurt. And do I feel better about myself after all the effort and worry I put into reading every food packet, forcing myself out of bed to work out, forcing down disgusting, flavourless meals because I am paranoid about the extra calories sauces and flavouring would add? No. I have developed a massive case of body dysmorphia, I find myself grotesque and I despise myself more than ever. I used to just dislike myself physically and behaviourly but now I do not even think I am human. I used to know I was overweight, but still likeable enough to not die alone. But damn, now I envy the people that get to cut me a wide berth. *I am* stuck with having to be around myself. If I were any of the people I am attracted to, *I* would not want me kissing me or making eye contact during conversation with me either.If getting 50,000 into student debt still cannot get me a relationship or friendship, if focusing and stressing so hard about what I eat and how I live still makes me even more utterly hateful of myself, if creativity was my passion and now my head is so disoriented and depressed that my ability to be creative has completely died for good, then I think I have tried enough. I cannot keep trying and failing. I am pretty sure I am done.I am not an 18 year-old who still has their best years ahead of them. I am 30. I have statistical, experience-based evidence that it does not get any better. I refuse to try for another 30 years and potentially get my first date or my first proper job at the age of 50. At that point, its just not worth it to me, and I know there are going to be some people who say it is who say life begins at 40 - but it is not. For most people, life begins at 16; from there, they make close friends, learn to drive, have wild sexual encounters and spontaneous travel adventures, find a home they feel comfortable in and have the strength and energy to make money to maintain it, and most importantly, they find love with someone who thinks they are worth something. I have done none of those things. But I *promise you,* I have tried.I am a logical person. I am a third of the way through my life, and its been a failure so far. Even if I tried for another third and succeeded, and then got to enjoy the fruits of that success with the last third, that is only a third of my lifespan worth living, and that is not enough of a percentage to make the extended struggle worth it to me. Its easier to just call it a failed attempt and go. I am honestly kind of glad that 30 is coming up and I made that promise to myself. It gives me a pointed reason to show this is not some spontaneous emotional reaction, but a legitimate planned attempt to try and improve things that has not worked out. I honestly have thought about offing myself early, but I guess my dad would like a photo of me at my delayed graduation (because of the restrictions), as he has a photo on his wall of all his kids and stepkids, but none of me, as I have not succeeded in anything. So I guess Ill wait for his benefit? (Before anyone says, I am not close to my dad, or any of my immediate family. Hanging around for their sake is not a legitimate reason. Blood is just a viscous liquid that transports oxygen, vitamins and nutrients around the body, it does not create convenient responsibilities to other peoples lives because that blood shares a similar coded structure). At this point, Id be glad to go. I have had suicidal points in the past but they were always emotional (and I always bear through them alone, having no-one I am close to or I feel really cares for or gets me). I always would not *want* to feel that way, get scared about it, not want to die because I wished my life would be different, and have a breakdown or deafen myself with distractions or something. But now I am genuinely, legitimately out of hope to the point where I am completely numb to it and I am not even upset anymore. Life is what it is. I have no emotion. What would I be sad about? The loving relationship Id miss out on? Its obviously not happening. And what a tragedy it would be to miss scraping by on living in a shithole month to month on an unliveable salary, eh? I guess I am only posting this because I am no longer myself at all - instead of being that bubbly and childish yet worrisome and cautious overly-emotional 21 year-old baby, I am now an untalkative, slow, ill-tempered borderline alcoholic who feels nothing. Id always felt it seemed selfish to pity myself when other people have it worse and I always cared way too much about what people think, but I do not care anymore, and I feel I have earned the right to be selfish and I deserve to have people know that if everyone other normal person can get recognised, respected, valued, wanted or loved to some degree, then I at least tried.I do not expect things to change over the next 6 months, instead of trying anymore I will just spend the time daydreaming about the better life inside my head and getting affairs in order. I am interested to see and hope that I have the bravery to go through with it in 6 months, but this really does feel like a turning moment where I have accepted it. I feel all that fear from when I was 21 has gone and I have the personal skills and the hopelessness to get out of this failed excuse of a lifetime.Sorry this was so long. And hopefully this does not just automatically confirm the idea that things *never* improve for anyone. If you are young and are thinking that, things may work out differently for you - it is a possibility. They just did not for me is all. When I was 21, I made a self-pact that if nothing in life was better by age 30, Id kill myself. I turn 30 in exactly 6 months.\",\"Depression\"],[\"I just want to die but I cannot.

Maybe I would not feel like I need to be the most accommodating, yet entertaining person whenever I visit home.Maybe if I was not born a woman, I would not feel the need to constantly perform.

I am on this like mental health journey trying to find what works for me and I do not really have anyone to talk to about it. I do not even have a family doctor lol. So here I am. I was on 150 XL for a month and I noticed a huge change at the start, my main issue was focus and chronic fatigue, but i found myself falling back to where I was at the end of the first month. Skip to the second month and my doctor kicks it into high gear and gives me 300 XL. The first few days I did not feel much of a change but after about a week or two holy fuck.I feel like I just slid into the side effects salon. For starters, totally forget to eat. I already hate cooking and some days its not until 1:30 in the morning where I am like, fuck, got to sleep but did not eat. When I do eat its only a meal a day. I started a fitness plan and a nutrition plan with a trainer and the food is so fuckin bland I am just not interested (I was 180 pounds before I started now I am 172). I am thinking of going back to some shittier foods so I regain some interest. My sex drive and everything related to sex has been cranked up to a million. Its probably the one thing I am struggling with the most. I am literally always horny (and it shows lol which can be embarrassing). My brain is telling me to go pick up multiple guys off the street and bring them to bed and the last sliver of logic I have is the only thing stopping me.I am never sleepy. I can sleep but I am never actually like, god I need to goto bed, therefore I forget the time and stay up late often. (It also feels like time is zooming by sometimes but idk if that is just me).Those are the major ones to list a few more; I am warm and sweaty all the time, social interactions feel bizarrely different, I have gone from being super insecure to not being able to get away from a mirror, dehydrated easier and I guess that is it off the top of my head.I am just curious; what subsides and what stays?

First time posting. Dunno where else to put this.Little background: I am a fit, healthy (mostly) M23 with a history of chronic and sometimes severe depression and frequent (daily) suicidal thoughts with a couple minor attempts some years ago... I am not on any meds but am contemplating taking them lately.My story of my sad summer (so far)This year started off pretty good, finally moved out for the first time last year and have been fairly happy. Have had no luck with the girls I like, even though I am apparently quite handsome. They just lose interest after a while and I have sort of given up on asking any out. Have moved into an apt. more recently with a longtime best friend from HS, which has been decent enough but we are drifting apart because of typical roommate shit. I have accepted it and I am okay with it, I think I would be fine without them in my life after this year. I do not have many friends otherwise though, and the new people I meet are mostly temporary friends. COVID restrictions in my city have also made it tough, particularly because I have not seen most of my extended family in over a year.Other than that I was having my hours gouged at work for a job and company I already hated, they cut me down to 12ish hours a week before I had enough. I would had a few thousand dollars saved so decided to quit. it is been fine since then, but money does not last forever and I do not have enough to support me for long. it is been a month with a little labor work on the side and I am nearly broke again. I was partying too much this summer in general so that does not help my money problem, going to the beach and drinking almost every day... doing coke all night with all kinds of people. From strippers to eccentric youths I have met at said beach. Gradually I began to feel I had a problem, tried to cut back and failed, every time I drink I just lose all inhibition. Finally quit for maybe a couple weeks and stayed sober, was tough but I am alive. Looking for a new job still, maybe not looking as hard as I should, then I get some bad news about my cousin, that is also my age and in the same city, who was partying (like me) and OD'd on drugs I have done before and nearly (or maybe lowkey did) OD'd on too... He was braindead and in hospital for a few days. Then another friend from HS few days later same thing. They died one day and the next. That was a week and a half ago, I broke my sober streak pretty fast. I never tell my parents this kind of shit and it hurts talking about my cousin and friend even more, especially when they say some dumb shit like how they were stupid for what they did etc... I have lost 3 friends my age to drug overdoses this year now and I think it is all just hitting me at once like the cars of a trainwreck smashing into one another and unable to stop.On the upside my best friend's birthday was this last week, though I almost did not want to go but convinced myself to so I could have a good time, and while on a raging bender I went with them and friends to another city to party. I think I drank almost constantly from breakfast to bed for at least 5 days straight and hardly ate a meal a day... It was a good experience all things considered, I made a lot of good memories in Montreal... that entire day and night of my friend's bday in particular was like an indie film... but I do not know if I have ever gone that hard in my life and it scares me in hindsight. I was doing a few different drugs with those friends on the birthday as well, literally all day, and disappeared with half of the drugs to go bar hopping when they did not want to go out of the air BnB we were staying in. They were not happy, and I did not have a working phone for them to call me on... or any of their phone numbers.That night was great but the day after... that hangover was the scariest I have ever had, and the day before we would all left to Mtl I broke my phone after getting home with a stockpile of booze so could not call anyone. I was pretty sure I would suffer a heart attack if I got up off my couch and decidedly stayed put for the entire first day and night I was back. My heart was POUNDING from the withdrawals as I would probably taken enough alcohol and coke \\u002f molly for three people. I think part of me wanted to die, though I do not think I would have as I am a fit 23 year old male but... I was pretty sure I would be the next of my friends to overdose that day. I like to think this has been transformative, but I am still drinking and I think I have a long way to go to get out of this rut I have dug myself into... but I have been here before. I tell myself I will not commit suicide, even if it feels like it would solve all my problems and set me free, because I do not want to hurt my family and friends. I feel I owe them all my life, hopefully a good life. I still think of jumping from my balcony every day though.Going to see my cousin's grave tomorrow and say goodbye finally. Lots of family will be there and I will be sober. it is going to be thunder showers all day so I got an umbrella. I think it is fitting. Maybe the hard rain will wash the tears from my face and the stains from my soul. I have been crying more these past weeks than I have through my entire adult life and I am ready for it to stop. I am not religious either, I still consider myself an atheist (not so sure lately) but I have prayed to \\\"god\\\" and asked to let me bear the burden of my family's grief so theirs might be lessened. Among other things. So I think this pain will never go away and I will just try to be strong for them and myself instead. I am not sure what I want from this post except to write about it and get it off my chest. it is been keeping me up tonight. Maybe I will start writing poetry again.So thank you for reading, if you did. I hope all of you out there stay well, there is beauty and meaning out there if you look for it. I have been finding much of it lately, just do not expect it to fall into your lap. Go out and find it. there is all kinds of wonderful things out there just waiting for someone to stand witness.

About 5 years ago now I was really struggling and made the decision to try therapy one more time as I finally had insurance that would cover part of it. Prior to this Id attempted therapy twice, once was 2 sessions with a student counselor through my college but I was ultimately told that the free counselors they could provide were not qualified to handle my range of trauma and that it would be better if a sought out a licensed therapist, which I could not afford. The next time I did try and go to someone who was licensed, they also told me I was not a good fit. I was seemingly functioning fine in the day to day (I thought I was, in retrospect not at all) and again my trauma was not their skill set. They suggested I seek out someone specialized. So I gave up for a while. It was not until my life was taking a major dive and I realized I was out of control to stop it that I tried again. Shortly before I began looking for a therapist, I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 26. In general, I am so pissed at not being listened to or just overlooked by doctors. That could be its own rant. But I was only diagnosed because I asked if it was possible. Id learned the actual symptoms of how ADHD presents in both women and adults for the first time and it was eye opening. So much of what Id complained about or told doctors I struggled with (attention, time management, zoning off) explained in one simple and now obvious thing. The tests were more than conclusive. So when I came across a therapist that specialized in ADHD along with, supposedly, some of my other specific traumas, I felt it would be good to be able to figure out a path forward with someone who understood how ADHD affects how I might function and think. The first red flag I should have paid more attention to, and I am still shocked by it. I had started to suspect I might be bipolar in addition to my depression, but was scared what that might mean for me. A few sessions in I brought it up. I still clearly remember her response: Oh no, you are not bipolar. You have cyclical depression. Bipolar you would have manic episodes where you think you can fly or kidnap a kid and think its your own, or *do really impulsive, damaging things*. I said the last bit sounds like me and she said But you do not think you can fly or that you are invincible right? I said no, she said not bipolar. I have never been diagnosed to this day, but the older I get the more I suspect it, and I know that there is more than one type of bipolar, and think she was very wrong to dismiss me. If she would have let me, I would have told her how I have times where I am convinced nothing bad will come of spending money that leaves me in financial ruin time and time again and I *know* its not normal. Or how I moved to a different country on a split second decision. Or how every tattoo I have ever had I have decided to get and gotten within 48 hours or less, with no foresight and usually regret after. At the start she was easy to talk to, and ended up helping me with my ADHD by giving me a referral to a doctor that specializes in only mental health, and they prescribed me meds that have vastly improved my quality of life. We did not focus on my past trauma at the beginning, its really hard for me to bring up and she would *never* ask me anything or suggest something from my life we should talk about *except* the ADHD. Which to me was a small facet of my life that was now being taken care of by the prescribing doctors (1 hour sessions, at the beginning there were 5 or 6 in the first 3 months and now they are once every 3 months). It got to the point of me just complaining about my problems from the week or my stresses about the upcoming week which was not really the reason I started going but it still helped. she would try and tie everything to the ADHD and I just let it go. I did not have the energy to find *another* therapist, I still figured wed get around to it eventually, and just knowing I had my weekly appointment coming up helped me get through a lot of the daily crap that would come up and Id have to deal with. After about 9 months or so of weekly sessions, she shocked me one day by telling me that she did not think she would be able to help me as I was too resistant to discussing the ADHD and that it was not worth the financial strain of the copay (which it was, I still paid $50 each session) to talk about my day to day problems. She said we should focus on an end date unless I was willing to put more work in to it. I said we still had not gotten around to *any* of what I told her I needed to deal with in my first session, and she said that she was not really qualified for the extent of my trauma but that we could try though she suggested I see multiple counselors *at the same time* and that was probably the only way Id be able to get the help I needed. Now, possibly the most overwhelming of my past trauma is abandonment related. Which she knew. In my brain there would never be an end to therapy. I was settling in to the idea of seeing her and every week until I moved or she retired. I was comfortable there, I felt safe with her and the routine, so when she said we should end things it brought it all back. I can truly see that moment as when the final dominos started to fall. I went from feeling to safe to desperate to be worthy. I agreed to whatever just so she would not end the sessions. The first thing she did was something that she told me was a new, exciting method to help patients stop disassociating and bring them in to the present. Was disassociating a problem, a little, but later found out what Id been describing to her is maladaptive daydreaming. She just decided it was disassociation because of the ADHD.The method was this: first you closed your eyes and sat very still and centered yourself. She would say feel your feet, feel your hands, feel your breath, etc. Basic meditation\\u002fgrounding exercises you can get free on YouTube. Then you would open your eyes and for however long until she said stop you had to tell her exactly what you are feeling and noticing and thinking presently. You could not think or say I am really stressed. It had to be physical like, I see a clock on the wall. My leg itches. there is a book on the bookshelf with a red spine. Anytime you would veer off a little, she would stop you and make you do it right. I *hated* it. Every time Id make these complaints, she would tell me its supposed to be uncomfortable, that is how you know its working. The thing was, Id spend all week preparing to talk about something important. Id take notes on what I wanted to talk about. I remember a few times I brought in letters or journals from my past I wanted to discuss and wed NEVER get around to any of it because she would spend at least the first 30 minutes doing the damn exercises, and another 5 minutes every other session trying to convince me to join her ADHD group therapy sessions, *which were another $50 copay*, no matter how many times I said no. I started leaving feeling frustrated and sad that I had not gotten to discuss what was actually quite difficult for me to prepare to say. Perhaps because of the fact that every single session I showed up with heavy thoughts on my mind and every single session she would force us to begin with this stupid exercise, but she made me *so much worse*. Id been casually disassociating *forever*. She did not teach me any skills to process or cope with these things being on the surface. But now my anxiety is tied with my life, I cannot separate the two. Doing things like looking at a clock or noticing a book on a shelf gives me anxiety. I am constantly overwhelmed by that fear of impending doom whenever I try and focus on reality. The only way I can get some respite is if I can manage to zone out the rest of the world entirely, which includes my day to day. I went from functional to entirely non-functional. Therapy with her ended when I had decided to move, which went badly. I was going to move in with a friend across the country. In the weeks leading up to the move anytime I expressed my doubts or fear something would go wrong she would tell me to stop focusing on the worry and just let something good happen. Yea, well, friend showed up to drive back with me and was a major AH and went from being my absolute best friend I have ever had, still, to years later were still not speaking. And I had no skills to cope, and had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. These days I am not even a little okay. I am not bringing in enough to make ends meet. My car is my income and it needs repairs. I used to shower daily, now sometimes I cry because I want to shower so bad and cannot bring myself to do it. The depression makes it so hard to get out the door and work, and if I do not manage it then the depression gets worse.

But I do not have the confidence or energy left to delude myself into thinking I have control over my life.I truly do not.

Everything I have done was out of my own short-term survival, whether that may be work for school or trying to cope with stress through escapism.So here I am. I am 18, faced with reality, and I do not know how to comprehend it. Once more I do not know myself. I never had the self-love to take care of myself during my high school years. I hated myself, and destroyed a chance of forming an identity through my own fear and loathing.I do not know how to describe myself. I am many things but also absolutely nothing at all. Pretentious as that sounds, it illustrates the tenuous grasp I have of my own self.I do not know who I am. I have vague ideas of who I want to be, but I cannot do anything because I have no autonomy over my own feelings.I am in a constant state of inaction or drowning myself in escapism. I have college to worry about, I still have not chosen my classes, but how could I? I do not know who I am, and any aspiration I have ever had I have never attained because of misfortune or inaction.So I give up. I have been severly depressed for the last seven month. Every day I wanted to die. But this past month its gotten better. Why? Because of escapism and leisure. Whenever I face reality I become depressed and scared. I can only live through other peoples stories and dream.I daydream all the time. I can never manifest anything.So I give up. I have no autonomy over this person I inhibit. They feel like a different person entirely from me. They will not relent with their bullshit, bad habits, and stagnation. My spirit is different from my person.I know I will never find self-love, because that requires autonomy, decision making, and motivation. I have none. I feel deprived of anything.How am I even supposed to find a romantic partner if I do not know myself? I will always feel alienated, from myself and others.Love is so beautiful, but something I will never experience.I do not know where Ill be in a year, let alone five, but I will have made self-destructive decisions like always. Whether they be big or miniscule, I have always been too selfless. I do not mean that in a self-aggrandizing way, but in a negative way. I do not feel good about myself.This makes me sound depressed, and I probably am, but the feeling is more akin to apathy. Why even try if I will NEVER be happy with myself.

I look at my life up until this point and really dwell on how many things I have been keeping to myself in mystical awe as to how I even manage to do it without driving myself crazy.I feel weird laying in bed tonight. it is 3 AM and I have work at 7 AM. Promised my girlfriend I would work out with her at 4 PM. I hope that still works out considering it is a promise, and I have not worked out in years and am just now mustering up the courage. I want to preface that this post at times may feel it is losing its direction. Sorry about that, I am writing what comes to my head. As I was saying, I feel weird laying here tonight. My mind has a lot of thoughts going through it. Mainly the sense of confusion as to what is wrong with me. Right now I feel like there is a long line in front of me (figuratively). Each thing in line is a different emotion. I am the receptionist at the front of the line, and on most days I would deal with each emotion one at a time. These emotions do not ever seem to have a regular pattern. They can be constantly changing from feelings of sadness to intense anger (internalized), happiness (not too frequent with this one), anxiousness, melancholy, and (what I see the most) a dissatisfying meh that says everything feels fine today, I am still moving along to the extent I can and not thinking about my true inner troubles.BUT tonight, I am not dealing with the line. I am just letting it build up and having the front customer ring the bell over and over for my attention. I am looking at this line with a feeling of confusion and unfamiliarity as if I never dealt with it before. I have all of the emotions stacked up and I cannot seem to be able to process them. I feel everything but nothing at the same time, it is white overwhelming but not at the same time. It sucks it took that long to explain how I feel currently, and the silly part is that I do not feel satisfied from that explanation alone. I notice that for a while I have been unable to trust MY ability, the inky real primary source of myself, to tell someone how I am feeling. Because I am never sure myself. I am never familiar with how I am day today or will be tomorrow. Maybe I am just overthinking all of this or maybe I am not. How am I able to tell someone how I am feeling if I cannot understand or validate my initial thoughts. I know I will probably wake up tomorrow and look at this and brush it off as a bunch of rubbisH, then push it to the back of my head for it all to come back again. FYI I am writing this completely sober. Where will I find my zen? I know that sounds cheesy, but for real, when and how will I find my inner self-understanding. I look at like with different mindsets, and they switch up every day or week without my notice. I just recently got a screen for depression, and for one I did not answer some of the questions honestly because I was too nervous too. But also these questions were driving me crazy, I could not tell how to answer any of them. If I answered them a second time the day after, I would have given different answers. That day I walked out of the doctor's office feeling self-critical and angry about this. I wonder if my mindsets change too much. Maybe my personality is too malleable? I understand that people change, but my view of how I view myself and the environment around me changes a bit drastically sometimes.I obsess over dumb shit. Waist too much time revisiting and spending extended periods of time pondering on them. Lately, I have been very concerned by the possible idea that I may be bipolar or something. I feel so stupid for even typing that out, but that is the truth as to how I have been thinking. I probably am not, and I just overthink everything. But it roots from my desperate want to understand my emotions. Recently, I had a day (i do not remember why) where I felt very very very low and sad. I have not had this feeling in a long time. I physically felt slow. I mentally felt unable to comprehend the external environment. I felt too lost in my head. The world around me shut off, but I was still going on autopilot. I was so sad, I felt numb. This was a build-up to this low from the past couple of days before. I was having some really dark thoughts I do not want to talk about. But the next day I felt so up, to the point I had a euphoric feeling in my body for part of it. Now I feel like I am starting to level out again. That day admittedly, I had a really fun day doing activities, so maybe it was that. But what throws me off is how I went from SO SO LOw (like you have to take my work for it) to SO SO. high.I could go on more and more, but my fingers would fall off from the typing, and I am starting to get tired.

But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help.

The time in school was easy to say pretty hectic, considering that I was suffering from massive headaches, anxiety and concentration problems. This could be reflected on my results in school, people would say that I was a lazy student and should work harder. I was very stressed out and, as opposed to the other students, I chose to spend my time differently after getting my diploma.This was a decision that I made in consultation with my parents. They took it very seriously and were very supportive and so I visited the doctor who figured I should see a neurologist. After a few appointments and a multidisciplinary research, they found out I was suffering from chronic migraine. At this point in time I was very happy to conclude that I was not crazy or anything, there was a serious reason to all of this pain I was suffering from for all these years.All of this time I spent most of my time in bed and playing videogames, because there was not really that much else I could do without overexerting my body. Playing videogames was like a nobrainer and it gave me the sensation of escaping from reality.Some more appointments followed up and I finally got a medication prescribed which could help me with the migraines. It was still not enough to get rid of the daily headaches so they gave me another medication called Candesartan... and luckily again, this reduced the pain by a big amount, but also the frequency of the migraine. I was feeling so much better now, but yet I was feeling that there was missing something.I was still very tired and bad at concentrating. Here is where I started to see a psychologist which referred me to a psychiatrist. This is where I get diagnosed with ADD, as of now I am still in the midst of getting medication for the ADD.Now the problem is, with all of these appointments a lot of time has passed. it is been a year now since the start of the sabbatical and I am still at home. I realise that I get a lot less joy from doing activities, but yet I know that this is temporary which makes me fight through this dark period for hopefully once and for all.In the beginning I did nothing else other than spending my free-time playing videogames when the migraine was very bad, but that was also partly because I was trying to avoid thinking about my area of expertise since I had a lot of anxiety of failure during my education and it gave me stress which I had never experienced before.Finally since a month or two ago, I finally started working again on hobby projects and realised that all of my knowledge had not left me behind. I was starting to feel more and more confident and until now I am developing a good portfolio for when I want a job.

In last 3 years it definitely got worse. I finally admitted that I have depression in front of myself and my friends\\u002ffamily. Everyone was not believing because I am funny and always willing to help anyone, the reason why I always act like I am happy is because I wish nobody suffer as I do. Few days ago I broke with my boyfriend because I felt like it dragging me down, he was not changing since we met (6years ago). Notorious quarrels, his alcoholism and other shyt. He is good but but I felt like I am in cage that I could not escape. In few days I moving on my own but I do not think anything will change. My monthly income is very small, althou its above minimum in my country, all I can pay is my apartment and only 1\\u002f3 of it will left for food and basic needs. Month ago I opened in my work by accident. Met fantastic person who have veeery similar hobbies. He listens heavy metal, plays on guitar, was vocalist in a band. I got inpiration and also bought guitar, start screaming under shower (fry scream - this kind of Metal scream many might consider only yells). It bring some relief for a second. After a month, when I already thought I learnt enough, I start loosing attention to it. Its not like I going to drop it, I just cannot force myself althou I love doing it. I always struggled to find a hobby because I lose interest very easily, not because I am bad at something, just getting bored quickly. I wanted be vocalist, biologist, programmist, write books, therapist (yup, mental disorders etc but how can I help others if need help). I liked gaming. It saved me at my early 20s. I could think of anything else thas not depressive because games took my thoughts out of it. Not for long. In last years I spoted playing because my friends found new jobs, gfs, moved to other countries. Now I am quite alone. I rarely speak with others outside my job. Yeaterday when I was searching for new heavy metal songs, popular monster - falling in reverse pop up. It hit me so hard that Iv been crying over and over and over and could not stop. I cannot help it. Do I have suicidal thoughts? Kind of yes. I rather think of something like would be nice if I die by accident, I would not mind it, but I hope I will not feel pain because I my whole life is big pain in the azz. Man, life is so pointless. I have no idea how people can NOT be depressed. I just wonders how they do it. What force them to live another day, another 8h in work.

It was great for a day and a half...Then my anxiety started kicking in. I started over analyzing everything he did during the time we spent together. I started to ruminate. And now it feels like all of the progress I have made has gone down the drain. I was not exactly going upwards in the week proceeding the meetup either, but it was not this bad. I am currently on anti-depressants, but I feel like they are not helping right now. I had two panic attacks yesterday, over really stupid stuff that should not matter in the long run since what I was considering were hypotheticals anyway. I also got drunk for the first time tonight, and that felt good. Had some sloppy sex with an FWB, and it was good. And now I feel bad again. Empty. On the way over to his place, I started thinking about suicide again. Like what if I decided to take my antidepressants before I was fully sober again, and kill myself? What if I just stopped caring and drove my car into a pole at 50+ mph?Like, I cannot handle this. I have been in love with him for more than a year after our breakup. These feelings refuse to leave, no matter what I do. I have done talk therapy, I have gotten a new job, I have tried going to college, studying, working myself into the ground, getting enough sleep and exercise, eating healthy. All of it for a month or so at a time, and I just do not feel good. I have also tried the quick fixes, like pot, alcohol, and sex. Oh, and the anti-depressants.These things do help, do not get me wrong, but especially recently I have been feeling like utter crap. And these feelings because guilt, and because me to want to reach out to him, and I know my ex would not push me away, but I do not want to rely on him too much. And talking about these things somehow make it worse... And I feel entirely at a loss for how to express my emotions without annoying, burdening, or causing other people pain. Being in love is getting tiresome. Trying to move on is getting tiresome. Life is getting tiresome. And to be clear... I do not blame my ex for any of this. I reached out to him.

My house:When you watch the TV Hoarders you are practically looking at my house. My house is a mess with dog pee pads all over the floor covered with urine and feces, the floors are soaked in urine, the dishes are scattered throughout with food still on it, boxes of packages that I have ordered and yet to open clutter my doorway, etc. I have mastered walking around or over things. My feet are always dirty from stepping through the clutter. There are bugs that have made themselves at home. I have wet clothes that have been in the washer for two weeks. I have cat litter boxes overflowing because they have not been cleaned in a while. I try to do things daily to lessen the mess but it just seems to keep building. The saddest thing is, I cannot see my lifestyle changing any time soon. My oldest dog has cushions disease and cannot hold her urine so she pees a lot and everywhere. I have a younger dog that is about 8 months now and I have tried potty training her but I find it hard to get the motivation to walk her multiple times a day so I found it easier for her to just go on the potty pads like my other dog. My mom comes over weekly to help me get a handle of this and clean up but it is never enough because there is just too much. The rest of my family and friends do not know about any of this because I do not invite them over. My sister knows but I do not think she knows how bad it has gotten over the years. And to note, this is not a new thing. This \\\"issue\\\" with my house has been going on for years. Hygiene: I have not showered in over a month. I have been using wipes to clean off different parts of my body that I think smell. I have not shaved my legs in months. I barely brush my teeth to the point that my gums bleed when I do. One of the reason I shaved my head to a buzz cut was because my hair was becoming matted because I was not washing it or brushing it.The hygiene \\\"issue\\\" is somewhat new. It has been going on for a few months but is getting worse. My mom does not know about this part of my life. I have been working with a psychiatrist trying to figure out medications to help but lately it has been hard to get ahold of her. I have called and left messages about my concerns with my mental health and medication but she has not responded at all and it has been over a week or two. I have done therapy in the past but have found it hard to find a new one since my last one moved away to a different city. I am truly drowning and sinking into a darker hole as the days go by.

In 2011 my best friend passed away in a bike accident at that time my age was around 15.That incident really affected my mental health badly and now still after 10 years i am really depressed about that thing.2) I wanted to become a Professional Football Player but tbh i never gave my 100% and after my friends death i started to stay at home and made my house comfort zone.Lost contact with all my friends and with the girl i loved(My First Love)3) Talking about my First Love i first saw her in 2005 and i had little bit of family drama with her family also where her parents came to know about the thing i liked\\u002floved there daughter.Her Mother was nice and just because i was a kid my age was probably 11-12 she said this is not the age to do love and these kind of things there is proper age for these kind of things.I apologized to my crush on fb and she did forgive me.After almost 1-2 years we became friends but there was a problem my one frnd was now her bf and they both were in a relationship.At that time i accepted the fact that with my crush the only relationship i am going to have is of friendship and nothing else.But somewhere deep inside i felt when we became friends and got to know each other personally she liked me but was waiting for me to make a move.4) In April 2021 while having a chat with my friend i get to know my First Love\\u002fCrush got pregnant and had done abortion recently.That news really fucked my mind up,i feel really bad for her bcoz her behaviour towards me was very nice she did forgive me and when i made the move for friendship she accepted me without any hesitation.5) I have health issues(Asthma and Diabetes) and my doctor has recommended to start exercising.Having Asthma was one of the reason why i gave up on my dream of becoming Professional Football Player.6) I have been having suicidal thoughts from past 2 years but now i feel universe is trying to help me in achieving my goals and trying to help me in my love life by giving news of First Love being Pregnant and Abortion.Doctor advising to start exercising i can take these things as positives and work on building and achieving my dream of being Professional Football Player i know it is bit late in terms of age for starting a career in sports but i want to give atleast one try for the things which i loved and that is Football and my First Love.I do not want die having regrets.7) there is a huge 10 year communication gap between me and my First Love because after 2011 after my best friend's death i made my home comfort zone.I have cried after hearing the news of her Pregnancy and Abortion i just want to talk with her and see her.I am not in a hurry of becoming her bf first i want heal\\u002fhelp her mental health\\u002fcareer wise.I want to marry her.But because we have huge communication gap i fear does she remember me.8) I have planned few things to make her remember times of us being friends and tell her my love feelings through it (Like for eg:- About the day when i saw her for the very first time) editing pictures(Written in story format and cartoon) and video edit (Stop Motion Video).But first i am going to try and build a bond with her like we had 10 years ago and i have plans to help her by giving her tips for growing her business and then i am going to express my love feelings towards her tbh from last 15 years she knows that i love her it is just i have never confessed my love to her face to face.( Please do not tag me as a creepy guy i have written everything what i really feel) ( Big Sorry for my Bad English i tried my best any Advice would be welcomed ) Life is trying to give me a second chance.Should I try my luck ? (Thanks In Advance)\",\"Suicidal\"],[\"DISAPPEARING WHEN YOU WAKE UP BUT THERES NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF EVEN WHEN THE NIGHT CHANGES IT WILL NEVER CHANGE ME AND YOU\",\"Suicidal\"],[\"Hello everyone! I just want to put a disclaimer that I am poor right now and I cannot afford therapy or even just the medicine alone.I grew out of wedlock and after a year of marriage, they had annulled their marriage because divorce is impossible here. I am barely hanging on a thread right now despite being currently semi-stable. So, I grew up to be extremely neglected by my parents, having no emotional support and it was really tough because I could not cry in front of my mom as it was considered weak. I would like to say that we are decently close because I came out as gay to her and my family included, but she is not really the type to give any emotional affection especially now that I am older. I have not heard any *I love you*s from both of my parents and they cannot tell me directly how they are feeling and that I have the same situation. We do not communicate at all and I am already 18 so I do not absolutely know what it is like to be loved through affirmations and physical affection. Currently, both of them have their own separate families and I am staying with my mom, but of course, I am living near poverty. It sucks because I have not really felt what family is nor do I feel belonged because most of the time it is forced interactions. My father messaged me that he was sorry, but he is not really because he just happened to know what was happening to me. If he was sorry, then he would have been at the start. there is too many information I could say, but know that I was emotionally neglected by both of my parents because they were too busy, too selfish, and too complacent.Anyway, I just wanted to know if it is normal to feel and say to myself these words while growing up: **I want to die**? It probably started on elementary when I was constantly bullied both physically and emotionally by my classmates and I remember trying to open up to my mother. I downplayed every problem I faced to my mom because she would often say how she is filled with problems, so naturally I had to talk to her in a non-worrying and non-stressful manner. She said to just be strong and fight back, and I did. For many years, I pointed a knife on my chest and wanted to stab myself with it many times at that age. But, I eventually moved on from that because I stood up for myself. It did lessen, but to my female classmate, it got worse.Moving on to 7th grade, I transferred and of course I was again on the center of ridicule with somehow showcasing slightly feminine behaviors. It was stupid, but I was made fun of, though I ignored it because I was better than them. I was intelligent; I was better than most of the kids at my age, however, I knew that I was going to be ridiculed always and such thoughts came back.Moving on to 8th grade where I transferred again because we moved places again, I was in a new environment. A more competitive environment whose friend groups and cliques have already formed and stabilized. I was basically an outcast in a block section of 40 students. I was terrified of crowds, I would often get nervous when conversing to other people, but that was fixed by myself when I joined ROTC for high school. Anyway, with me being an outcast and people avoiding me because they already have their own friends and also me having a quirky personality, I often spent my time alone or trying my best to sit with others. Since, I felt so deprived of friendship and bonds, I subconsciously wrote \\\"I want to die\\\" again in a piece of paper because that is what I felt and I never talked about it to my mother, even up until now.9th grade came and I was raped by my uncle. I was scared and scarred, mainly because I thought I was going to contract any virus. I attempted to ask help from my mom, but I downplayed it again to just a dream and mentioned it was vague. I was afraid of putting someone in jail, afraid of what others will think of me, and afraid of what will happen in the future. Up to this day, I am still frightened by the thought and image of him, but I already have moved on from the nightmare. I cried many nights because I still did not have any close friends and I was always called weird. 10th grade was a bit better and more tolerable and I ranked 2nd on the whole batch. This was the time, before I transferred again to 11th grade, I hooked up with someone from Grindr. It was mainly a one-time thing, but then when I reached 11th grade and moved to a more-populated area, I found myself using that app many times to seek comfort, connections, and distractions to my problems. This was the time I recognized my mental health was worsening even more. I attempted to jump off a building twice, but failed. First was I talked myself out of it and the second was I slipped backwards and broke down. Or so I like to tell myself. I made those two scenarios up because that would at least have a more viable scenario for my situation. Truth is, I am scared of pain and being shouted to at. I fear being left out when people come in my life. It is what it is, but I am damaged. I mentioned to my mom I was suicidal, but she also said that she is suicidal and I should deal with my thing.12th grade and graduation came and until now, I realized a lot of things. I know who to blame for damaging and scarring me and I have been trying my best to cope. Again, there were so many scares that I dealt with HIV-scare (I am negative), but when you gain enlightenment, it is just dragging you even more down to the abyss. All the nights I cried and had panic attacks, all the unnecessary self-hate by hooking up and trying to OD myself, and all the negative suicidal thoughts in my head right now are all present in my head clashing.Right now, death is the closest comfort I have because I cannot handle these emotions and thoughts anymore. I feel suffocated, trapped in my own hell. I do not want to be abandoned; I want to be loved and to be hugged, and be said that I matter to the people I care and think about. I think I might just take my life sooner or later. I made a promise to myself to kill myself in two years if I do not find a constant source of happiness and I feel as if things are being faster and now I just want to remove the mountain on my back and finally feel peace through death. I just want to be loved, but it seems comfort and eternal peace is my only option right now. I do not want to be invalidated that those are not my options because (1) I am poor, (2) my parents and I do not communicate about our feelings and experiences, and (3) death is a permanent solution to my permanent problems.

So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me (21), she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines\\u002ftoys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up, I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14, I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up (one street over) and as soon as I got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him, but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall, I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I, that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked (mental breakdown?) but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies, get everything in order. I said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him. I do not even know if I am overreacting or what. What should I do. I think my Dad might kill himself\",\"Suicidal\"],[\"guess who will die today? thatâs me!!

I love him so much, but I do not understand why.At the beginning of the pandemic, he a new condo and I moved in with him. We slept in separate rooms many nights because we both snore so bad.I loved being with him all the time. But the feeling was not mutual.My partner knew about my demons with drugs and depression -- he also had a drug problem about 10 years ago. I admitted to him that I had been doing heroin almost every night in December 2020. I pleaded for him to not leave me over this and that I was going to rehab as soon as my FMLA benefits were active so I could go to rehab. I wanted to be honest and open, and I was.On March 2nd of this year, I told my partner that I would be starting treatment on March 16. I was very proud of myself for doing this. He, however, flipped out on me and told me that I needed to move out. Now I had to drop out of the rehab program so I could find a new apartment and pay for the move. This led me to spending most of my money on heroin.I expressed to my ex back in March that I was very suicidal. He told me I would never be able to live with myself if you did that to me.I still see him a few times a week. Why, though?Anyway all of this has led me to crippling suicidal thoughts for the last couple of months. The only reason I have not done it yet is because my apartment is a mess and I do not want to put the burden of cleaning up on anybody I know.But I guess it does not matter on my end. Ill never see these people again, right?I am quite sure that I am going to be done with all of this by the end of July. I cannot take life anymore. Humans are horrible.tl;dr: I am a 35 year old gay man who has been experiencing depression for the last 25 years or so. I am also an addict. The one person that I love broke up with me in March right before I was scheduled to go rehab. I have nothing now except sadness and anxiety.

My social anxiety has gotten so severe that I am afraid to even walk outside my own backyard for fear of people seeing me. Even though I am introverted, I have always loved spending time with my friends. Now I do not even have the energy to go out anymore, and I miss them all dearly.

I am introverted after all and I just relaxed and enjoyed the peace. But after a year since the pandemic has began, the solitude began to take its toll. I have felt lonely. Which eventually led me to being depressed. In the beginning of summer I was finally able to come to the city A, and meet my two closest(and perhaps only) friends. I have been here for nine days, then went to another city for two weeks and came back here for another two weeks.The social interactions with my peers, which I have craved so much and have finally gotten, made me happy, but not for long. At some points, they did not even distract me and I was as miserable around my friends as if I was by myself.I realized sometime before, that nothing makes me truly happy. I have been extremely pessimistic about my future and everything really. Soon Ill go to college and the boring, sad and dull adult life might begin.Anyway, for quite some time I have been venting about all of this to my closest friend. Today may have been the last time I saw her before our five\\u002ften-year class reunions. we have decided to hang out(+my 2nd closest friend), but it turnt out not that great.Not only did I saw more proof that she does not really care about me(smth I realized not so long ago), but also she was cold. Most importantly, during our final goodbyes, she told me it was hard to be friends with me because of the negativity and pessimism I bring. Yeah, I was already sad, but that just made it worse. I am a burden and I knew that but I did not expect her to say smth like that. Totally understand and don blame her at all.

Got diagnosed with ASD (basically what most people call Aspergers) and got on some meds for awhile.Meds helped a bit with the anxiety but they turned me into a zombie, effectively killing the last two neurons I had left.Dropped the meds and decided to try my hand at college again...it was pathetic, performance was even worse than before and I washed out a second time.Could not hold a steady job during this entire time either. I am so fucking stupid I fuck up even basic tasks. I have Worked a string of minimum wage jobs here and there until now and I have sucked at every one of them.Here I am about to turn 26 and I fucking hate what a pathetic looser I am. (I am a autistic, friendless, borderline unemployed, virgin dumbass who struggles to perform basic everyday human activities)My failures are not just academic and work related.

I have never had a friend, never dated, had sex or even had a halfway decent conversation with anyone not related to me. Every interaction I have ever had has been nothing but surface level politeness nothing more. Not that I would have anything interesting to say to anyone anyway since I have no life experiences or interesting thoughts to share. I have basically been a hermit for as long as I can remember.

Successful, smart, loved and respected. My parents would never say that they are disappointed in me, their love for me is unquestionable. I can however see it in their faces; feel it everytime they ask how I am doing or what my plans are.

I give up. I am tired of being a damn waste of oxygen. I cannot stand another day of struggling on a shitty job, only to come to an empty apartment and sleep until the next day because I do not have it in me to try anymore...I have tried, for 26 years I have given everything I got and it always failed.

I am tired of never being taken seriously. I am tired of being alone. I am tired of never having anything go how I want it to.Some of you may read this and think its impossible to actually fail at everything and yet here I am. The only things I possess have been handed to me out of pity by my family, superiors or just the occasional kind stranger. I have not earned ANY of what I have. It is actually a bit comical how bad I am at just living. My existence has an almost slapstick quality to it, the problem is that while that shit may be funny on screen its actually fucking depressing in real life.So here I am typing this while I think about wether I should buy Helium or a Shotgun. Helium would be peaceful and leave an intact corpse (less traumatizing on my survivors) . But a shotgun seems faster and easier to acquire ('Merica!) but my head will essentially look like someone threw a plate of chunky tomato sauced Spaghetti at the wall...

My names Nat. I am 16, trans (she\\u002fthey), and autistic. All of these play a factor into what I feel may be underlying factors playing into my depression and self-sabotaging tendencies. It seems as if every friendship or relationship I have is toxic in some regard, mostly due to my influence. I am horrible at making new friends, so whenever an old friendship has officially concluded I continue to try and call them back to me, so I no longer will bathe in my own desperations and self-loathing ideologies. I beg and make a fool of myself. And the few friendships I have maintained have only been at the expense of others. Even if they say they do not mind caring for me and helping me through these problems, even if they are also there to lend a helping hand, I never feel as though I do enough in return to grasp it and accept it, that is, their love. I make a bigger deal out of problems constantly, and have no reasonable output or control of my emotions. Something as small as someone leaving me on Read can lead me down a dark spiral into depressing thoughts and much darker ideas. I feel I am not one singular person, but many different people trying to take control of a body that refuses to cooperate. The small glimpses of happiness and fulfillment are quickly overshadowed by long, drawn-out periods of mania and depression. I never feel happy with life anymore. Even when I am enjoying life, I always have a feeling in the back of my mind that I could be doing better, that I could be getting more out of life.For example, I started my first job yesterday and I loved it. The people there were really nice and helpful, and despite not wanting to work in Fast Food, I really enjoyed my time at Sonic working there. But last night I had a breakdown because I kept thinking of all the little mistakes I made and how I felt I would stay where I was and continue falling behind my coworkers. I feel as if I do not deserve peoples sympathy and love, but at the same time, crave it more than anything. I am willing to completely change who I am for someone I find admirable. My life at this point has no balance, and the smallest hint of work or anything adult like college and taxes, I shut down and am unable to function like a normal human being. Something as simple as my friend saying Sorry for not texting back, I was at work makes me want to dispose of my phone and hide away in my room from everyone, to shut myself in from the outside world. Because I feel inferior to them, I feel I could somehow be better, even if they and I are on a similar level of ability.

I asked my mom if I can go to my best friends birthday party yesterday, and she said no. But that is not what bothered me, she said \\\"Your best friend better not introduce you to any guys\\\". She said some other homophobic things to but I forgot what she said. I lost a lot of faith in my LDR working out.Since we come from an asian family, there is a lot of asian guilt. My dad is leaving us next year to go back to his country (as he is separating from my mom), and the idea of me moving out is gone because part of me feels extremely guilty for leaving my mom alone when she does not make enough money. But on the other hand, I know she is extremely homophobic and she even discourages me from making friends too much.

My therapist and gf suggested I take a medical leave, but I was concerned about having those free extra hours to drive me crazy, and about my career. Gf suggested she could work from my place and keep me company. And if I felt anxious, she would be there. I accept the idea of the leave, and immediately become a different person. Therapy does wonders without the anxiety of work, and the cloud of depression is gone. The little voice tellling me everything will go wrong and Ill be alone is gone. I feel safe. I feel happy. I feel hope.Two days before the medical leave, she asked me when she gets to meet my parents. Big step! But it just makes me happier, my life is going somewhere, the depression is lessening exponentially, and I have clearly met someone that loves me.The day before the leave begins, she dumps me via text. It had been 9 months. Of course, I went from moderately anxious and depressed, to severely so. However, at least, she promises she will still be with me every step of the way, and I could call whenever. I start a PHP, which is more intensive group therapy. On day 3 of the PHP, they pull me out of therapy to tell me I am clearly too depressed for their program and they might have to release me, aka kick me out. I did not mention any suicidal thoughts, but I guess they saw something in my attitude. I freak out, even the people that are supposed to help me tell me I am too broken for them. I am in crisis and scared and my ex comes over. She spends the whole day with me, about 10 hours. She tells me she is in love with me, that she will be there. Day 4 of the PHP: they kick me out. I text my ex, and she responds asking me to delete her number and that she cannot help me anymore. In the span of 5 minutes, I lose my entire support system. I become suicidal.I get worse and worse, and start making plans. That scares me so much I text my ex regardless, being honest about it: this is not about getting her back, or a manipulation tactic this is a human being that is terrified. She made promises that allowed me to depend and lean on her, and broke them all. I understand giving an ex space, but I am also fighting (and losing) for my life, so I do not think its that disrespectful of her space. She never responds.My mother discovers how bad I am and stays with me. She helps with daily life stuff, but I am way too broken. I keep thinking of my exs behavior as a betrayal. I tell myself this is proof that I cannot count on anyone, that my life will always suck. My mother hugs me, I feel nothing. I keep getting worse, and have an episode where I just went catatonic. she would talk to me and I would not respond, forget about eating. did not move for hours. She gets so scared she calls a friend of mine. Same deal, hugs me, says hes here for me, but it does not nothing for me. The damage of the betrayal seems to have put me past repair.I get hospitalized, but when sent back home immediately feel as before. I just lost the ability to hope, and be affected by others. I wake up crying. I do that all day until I go to sleep.. still crying. Sometimes I stop crying, but its out of exhaustion, not having gotten anything out. Sometimes because I scream while I cry and my throat hurts too much. This goes on for 2 weeks. I swallow my pride, and beg my ex for help. If no one can get to me, maybe she can. If the betrayal can be undone, maybe Ill stop seeing the world as my enemy. She did promise.. but no response.After the third week, my mother in desperation calls her. We know its bad, we know its not healthy, but this is starting to be life or death. She created a dependency with her promises and it broke my mind, my mother hopes that I will react to her.Ex shows concern for a moment, calls (although my mom did not hear the phone). My mother calls back, but it goes straight to voicemail, and we never hear back. She blocked her too..I have done everything. The drugs, the hospital, the PHP, the medical leave. My support system is not helping me, not through fault of their own, they just cannot get me to move or eat or feel anything. I get no warmth from their hugs. We disrespected my exs boundaries in desperation hoping she would make a difference, but she apparently has left me to die. I have done it all. I want it to end. I have begun planning for it, and its destroying my family. I could get hospitalized yet again, but the underlying issue always returns: the betrayal broke me. I had plenty of other issues (physical health, work, pandemic), but was still getting better, fought against it all. Until the betrayal. It does not seem like I can get out of this one.

We became friends with benefits because as an attractive man I run into a lot of women who only likes me for my looks but breaks up with me because my depression is so bad. And to mention between us two I was the more attractive one and she leaned more towards average. I was 22 when we met and she was 18. I enjoyed her intelligence and could look past the obvious difference in attractiveness. She took the time to understand my mental health and stuck by me through my issues. I also help her with her family issues because her father was emotionally abusive and her mother is classified as psychotic but refuses help. As time went on we became increasingly involved with each other romantically and sexually which we both always consented to. My mother kicked me out so I wanted to get an apartment and she offered to be my roommate because she could not handle her father any longer. We finally got the apartment and it was like a dream come true we were always happy and barely argued and had more sex than we could even imagine. We adopted a kitten and I worked over night at Lowes as mst so I could barely stay awake to take care of the chores. And when I would be awake I would finally relax and play the Xbox for a little. She did not have a job and was paying rent with unemployment checks. Once unemployment ended I had to take care of the bills untill she could find a job 2 months later. I helped her start a tarot business and that brought in no where close to the amount required for rent. Though I still supported her even after also paying late fees. So when it comes to my depression and suicidal thoughts its random and the only way Id cope is by making music , gaming and smoking weed. Her grandpa caused me to lose my job because he would always drop me off late even though I was paying him . So I was coping with this failure with my usually vices while she finally was hired . But I did not get the same support I displayed for her when she did not have a job . Music was paying the rent until my song was stolen by bk the rula. So I was in the deepest void that I have ever been in because this apartment was my first attempt at independence. She usually took acid at least 3 times a month for meditative reasons and suggested that I should try it because someone said it helps with depression and self realization. I was skeptical so I did not take it until 2 months later. She planned on taking it at the same time so I finally consumed it. The problem is she did not take hers and went to bed. I did not know this and began feeling the effects. At first it was pleasant and gave me this feeling of joy and an unwavering arousal. But then things took a really bad turn . I owned color changing led lights and the walls felt like they were closing in on me. All i could think about was killing myself; nothing felt real thus convincing me that if I died nothing would matter or be concrete. I started punching myself and trying to rip out my hair. Then for some reason the flashing light got faster and increasingly vivid. I felt as if I was falling into my mattress while dying 1000 different ways in my mind but my thoughts felt like reality. Nothing existed but my sad scarred soul. I finally convinced my broken mind to get up and ask her for help . I was gripping the sheets trying to find something that felt real or I would have surely slit my own throat. Of course the feeling of arousal never left because that was the first reaction I received after consuming the substance. So her being the only woman I was intimate with I always felt comfort in her breasts and she has always consented prior to this incident. So for sum reason while under the influence I felt that her Boob was the most concrete thing in my reality so I held it while being the big spoon. She instantly told me to back off so I got up and left immediately feeling shame loneliness. I felt meaningless and was convinced that I was truly alone and should not exist. I lost my mind in my room until I passed out. The next morning I was finally coming down and was beyond traumatized. I spoke to her and explained what happened but all she could focus on is how she was traumatized from me holding her boob. I reminded her that we shared a bed every other day and that cuddling like that is a normal occurrence because we loved each other and pretty much was dating without a label. She finally seen it from my side and understood how scary it might have been for me. She held me and told me she was sorry and that she should have noticed what was going on.she offered to have sex to make me feel better but I declined because I am not into sexual pity. Also my depression has extremely increased since I have took the acid. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. She just abandoned the apartment and left me with the cat and half of my property was locked in her room. She did not come back until the last day and told everyone in my family and her friends that I sexually assaulted her. I was hurt and confused because I was left with a kitten and was losing my apartment that I worked so hard for. I paid for everything in there all she owned was a few things in her room. And to say I sexually assaulted her is a defamation to my image and character because I have never forced myself upon her .so I was angry , heart broken and betrayed so I attempted suicided by slicing down my wrist with a razor and the razor was pretty much half way lodged into my wrist . My mom found me before I could bleed out and rushed me to the er. When I got back home I got into the locked room grabbed all my things and sum evidence (her diary that she started when we first moved in) and left with my kitten. Till this day she will not talk to me and is telling people I sexually assaulted her . Am I in the wrong ? The experience in that room full of lights still replays in my head and haunts me to this day . My friend who was once raped twice in the Dominican Republic says that this situation does not count as sexual . Can anyone give me advice on how to cope or what should I say to her or if I should take legal action? This would have never happened if I did not believe her and took the acid as a cure for depression. I was stupid for being so nave but therapy does not work and I am not up to taking any man made medications anymore .

For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse. I have never felt more alone and scared in my life, I think about suicide every minute, and I have come up with a plan. I am 23 with no college degree, barely any work history, with no hope for an actual future. I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her. I feel so trapped, so hopeless, so terrified. I know that makes me a selfish person, I know I need to suck it up and help my mom. But fuck I do not know how I can keep going like this.

Why am I so worthless?\",\"Suicidal\"],[\"I have wasted my whole life doing nothing but playing mobile games all day and sitting on the couch all day. I am already 19 years old and I still do not even have a job yet which is truly sad and pathetic. My own parents are actually trying to threaten me that if I do not get a job, they will kick me out of the house right after I graduate high school. I have 1 year left to graduate. I honestly do not care what my parents will do anymore, I just want them to kick me out so I can end my own life. I never really cared about myself nor wanted to live. I do not have the guts to kill myself now so I am just waiting patiently for my parents to help me end my pain. I am planning to just end my own life right after I graduate. Chronic procrastination has affected my life in so many ways. Its affected my physical health, my hygiene, my relationship with my family, my school grades, and my mental health. I have struggled with chronic procrastination ever since I was in Elementary School. I did not really know what is wrong with me in the past but based on my own research, I am now 100% sure that I am struggling with chronic procrastination. ADHD is the reason why I struggle with chronic procrastination. Chronic procrastination has pretty much took away my happiness and gave me nothing but self hatred. I hate myself and I hate the way I am today. I truly want to change all of my bad habits, but its just too difficult. I cannot even do something as simple as brushing my teeth everyday which again, just shows how pathetic I am and how much of a mistake I am. I have tried to change my bad habits in the past but like a drug addict, I eventually relapsed back to my old bad habits. Trying to change my bad habits feels like asking a person with smoking addiction to stop smoking completely which is why its very difficult for me to change. The fact that I cannot change my bad habits no matter how hard I try, makes me feel like maybe I should just end my own life so I will not end up disappointing my family. Maybe I am just born to fail on life and never succeed. I no longer see confidence in myself and I do not see any point of trying anymore. So nowadays, I just let chronic procrastination destroy my life. My everyday life is pretty much playing mobile games all day and sitting on the couch. I honestly cannot stand doing the same thing everyday, but I know that even if I tried changing, I am just going to fail anyway. My weight is increasing every month due to lack of exercise but I really do not care because I am just hoping a heart attack will kill me. My dental health is not looking good either but again, I really do not care. All I am doing today, is just waiting for my death and thinking about what I should do now before I end it all next year. I wish I could just sleep forever so I can escape this reality but I know that is not possible. This year has been difficult for me, sometimes I cry in the night because of the amount of pain I am going through. I am tired of pretending that I am ok in front of my parents. They really have no idea how much pain I am going through nor how long I have suffered with this pain. The more we argue and the more they yell at me, the worse I feel about myself. The more I think about my past memories, the more I hate myself. Playing mobile games all day is more of a coping mechanism to me because it helps me escape reality and it helps me distract my brain from the pain. Everyday I act as if nothing is wrong with me but I am just hiding it really well. I am hiding my emotions through distractions. I deserve everything that is happening to me and I do hope I get COVID a 2nd time and hopefully end me this time. I am just done with my life. 1 year left to live\",\"Suicidal\"],[\"I need to go soon but I am a pussy of course. Is this if done correctly, will this be fast, successful and fairly painless?

I say anything back and they think I am disrespecting. They think giving advice like \\\"you are a little brat and you will not succeed in life ever and you are going to work in a horrible job or be homeless\\\" is good advice.I really should not be complaining considering my life is just so much better than most people I have read in this sub-reddit. it is just that I have felt like this for constantly and I feel like nobody wants to help.I am quite stupid and very stubborn. Probably inherited it from my parents as they are both stubborn. They constantly say things like \\\"You do not love me\\\" and that \\\"I am going to die one day\\\" and it really fucking hurts when they say that.I wish I could talk to my parents about suicidal thoughts properly. They are very dismissive that I have any mental health problems so I do not think they will care. I do remember vaguely as a child my mother said \\\"I wish I never had you\\\" or something along the lines. I would not of remembered it if it did not happen.I do not want to really talk to them either as one has been previously suicidal and has anxiety. I do not want to worry them any further as they always complain about it. I do not know if I can call myself their son if I constantly act like a piece of shit.Another thing I really hate is that I am forced to work. My parents say \\\"I am not forcing you to work\\\" but if I do not work, my brother and my family will threaten to take everything away from me (usually my phone) which is a huge detriment to me as I only really have friends online. During my summer holiday, which is now, instead of taking a break I am forced to work from 5pm till about 11:45pm.It does not help I do not sleep until times such as 7-10am as I want to have some time for myself without having to have a worry at the back of my head.I feel targeted, useless and a detriment to my family. I am called selfish and useless often and since I am the youngest, my problems are disregarded and called small.My childhood I was constantly compared to girls and other people and how much better they are than me and how they wished they had a girl instead. I hated it, I told them I hated it, they do not really care and say they are not comparing.it is amazing how I am being insulted at this very moment and currently being told to have my feelings suppressed and I am acting childish and I should just suck it up. it is amazing how much they do not care about me and they do not listen to a word I say. Sometimes I wish I was not so lazy and just ended myself. Enough of my sulking and running to my bedroom to cry, back to whining.I just wish I could seek help without being judged, without having that negative stigma, without hurting any feelings. I really cannot take this anymore.I often have suicidal thoughts but in the end of the day I am so useless I cannot force myself to get up, and just jump and snap my neck. Not like I am going to do anything about it, I am just a whiny attention seekerI suppose what really hurts my mental health is that a lot of my friends rely on me to help with their mental health issues, I have been helping for like 2.5 years and I really cannot handle it anymore. It hurts to see my friends like this, and it hurts that I cannot do anything anymore. they have had therapy but it does not work, so many of them rely on me. But nobody has the patience to help me since I am very very stubborn.I wish I can change, but I give up so easily. Working out? Give up in about 2 weeks. Drawing? See others do better and think \\\"people are better, there is no need for me\\\".I am such a stupid problematic piece of shit it is comical. I envy a lot of people that succeed because I am an asshole quite frankly. Seeing people achieve happiness and change, something I cannot do.I do not know if I can change at all.

And seeing as the south does not have any truely functioning mental health knowledge\\u002fsystem we had no idea what we where doing to each other and all the ramifications of those 6 years.

I was admitted to hospital by my school in 2019 (I am in college now in the UK) and was discharged the same day because my father told me to lie (to which I did) and the doctors said my cuts needed to be deeper in order for me to be depressed.

Yesterday this car was speeding by us and it was also pretty close, I had to stop myself from stepping in front of it, and I almost did step in front of the car.

They broke up for 2 months around 2017, a little before her suicide attempt, then they resumed their relationship. He broke up with her yesterday and she tried to take her life. She called me crying and sobbing loudly from the hospital yesterday. She told me that she told him he did not want to be with her anymore. She basically crumbled. Her mom called me today and told me that she tried to take her life but they found her in time. I really dislike the boyfriend, if I am honest, I have never been a fan of him. Hes always seemed off to me, distant. But as her friend I always made the effort to support her decision to be with him. Right now she is still hospitalized and crying inconsolably. Her psychiatrist is traveling to where she is (she is out of town, about 18 hours driving away). I feel really sad that i cannot be there for her and her mom. I do not know how to continue to support her. I want to be there 100%. I have never been depressed so I do not know how to approach it.

I was practically bullied everyday, never physically but the words just stuck with me. 6th grade came around and my depression just slowly started getting worse. this is when my long journey of self harm started (i will not go into detail) but i got to the point that id do anything just to feel something other than sadness. this is when my friends slowly started to stop talking because they noticed the shift of energy. we were kids, we were not supposed to feel this way and nobody else wanted to be around someone that was like me. because of this i turned a majority of my time and focus to social media, i stated creating anonymous accounts just so i could have somewhere to express what i was feeling. i some how got sucked into a rabbit hole that lead me to kik. if any of you know, that app had been busted numerous times because of the child groomers that were on the app. this is when i had my first experience of being manipulated by an adult. (again, i will not go into detail but this happened for months). skipping to 8th grade, I am still self harming at this point. a friend ended up seeing the marks, which caused me to just change methods. Eventually, i did quit because i just knew it was time for me to give it up. From my freshman year to my sophomore year, my depression stayed steady. I was still experiencing suicidal thoughts, but i knew i was not at risk of going through with it. I wanted to die, but i just could not get myself to go through with it? i guess its a fear of not knowing what will happen after? My junior year of high school was the start of a downward spiral i would have never predicted to happen. I ended up losing my dad, we thankfully had a good relationship. i was 16 so it absolutely destroyed me when he passed, especially with how sudden it was. I ended up binge eating constantly because it was my way of trying to cope. in total i believe i lost about 4 relatives that year. a few months go by and i start talking to this guy, we end up hanging out and this is when i was sexually assaulted aka this is how i lost my virginity. the reason i feel so guilty is because i continued to talk to him after, and we met up twice after. i truly just wanted him to want me, the movies made it seem like losing your virginity was this magical thing. i just feel like people would say that i was not sexually assaulted because I continued to see him? but i swear i said no multiple times, i tried to push him off of me, i can vividly remember what his weight felt like i felt as if bricks had been stacked on my chest to the point i could barely breathe. to this day i can still remember what it felt like, it nearly sends me into a panic attack everytime.after this, i knew nothing would ever be normal again. i remember going home showering immediately and i just scrubbed at my skin for what felt like hours. you are probably wondering, why did not you report it?. i was scared, my mom thought i had been hanging with a friend not a guy 4 years older than me. in the moment i thought id be the one in trouble. this still haunts me to this day, i always wonder if there was more i could have done. i would try to think of any excuse for what happened. anyways, i had told 3 close friends about what had happened and my guy friend said , it sounds to me like something you just regret and that you are trying to make an excuse. which again, caused me to feel even worse. after this i just kind of used my body as a way to seek validation? i was constantly having sex in the attempt to make someone want to be with me. and that brings us to now, obviously there is tons of other things but this message is just getting too long.

I will never try to do anything, to find a job or relationship or a house to live alone. I will never become independent not because I cannot but because I do not want to. I want to stay with my mom forever, alone with my books in my room like a teen and go out only with her. I cannot take responsibilities, I cannot make decisions not because I am stupid but they make me feel so anxious and panicked and I do not know how to manage this. I still remember 8 years ago when I tried to rent a house to stay alone twice and I panicked too much and in the end I cancel it. I still remember how I felt 10 years ago when I attempted to live alone in another city for studies and how depressed and alone I was. The furnitures my parents bought are still haunted me whenever I see them in my grandma's house. And maybe I was 18 years old and I had to deal with a very difficult situation in my house but I am still unable to take action.My situation does not make me happy, I feel bored, I want to do something different and exciting but I cannot. I cannot even think to live as an adult, to have a romantic relationship or a stable job because I am afraid of all the conflicts that may occur. Maybe these things have to offer me exciting things but I am aware that as more you expose yourself and take responsibilities you have also more problems to deal with. And I had enough problems in my life already.Some may think that I am immature or spoiled or sheltered and the last two I believe that are true but I am not immature at all. This maybe is the problem that I do not get never excited because I overanalyze things and try to see all the different perspectives. People around me rent houses without second thought, say lies thst they have experience to take a job and generally grab chances without thinking it a lot. Even if they do wrong they do not punish theirselves and they do not feel bad if in the process they treat unfairly some people. I cannot even sleep thinking all my past wrong decisions, I am not able to say a lie even for the most unimportant thing. I am unable to deal with anything or to put it correctly I cannot deal with my feelings. Even when someone hear sent me a private message I get panicked, I do not know how to react and I think of that all the time. I can start a conversation when I am too desperate and I know that maybe I will not be alive long enough but sooner or later I start to fear that someone is going to harm me or discover or harass me etc. This is probably the main problem I am so afraid of everything and even if I fight it and try to make steps in the end I always go back to my parents security even if it is toxic. And I feel relieved and I can sleep at nights but I also feel so desperate and empty. it is not my fault that I feel this way. My father is a negative person and make me feel afraid of the works and people because he always showed me the worst case scenario. My mom tried to protect me and give me moments of entertainment and not let him spread his negativity but she is also a victim and a depressed person and life was not easy for her. Our life in general was not never easy many bad incidents happened to our family, put of out control and these made my father even more convened for his worldview. I do not know what is wrong with me, is my traumas, my ocd, my social anxiety? Do I have the Peter pan syndrome and I want to stay child forever? Am I autistic and that is why I find the world so terrified? Is my county and how unorganized and corrupted everything is here that make me feel so desperate? I feel like my life has an expire date. I do not know if I commit soon or no but I know that when my mom dies this will be my end also. Maybe I will end everything sooner because there is no point I feel so miserable and I just waste money. Therapy and medication never were helpful on the contrary the made everything worse.

My grandparents would not even let me to groom my hair properly or wear perfumes because that would attract girls! I had never met or talked to a girl for my intire life till I was in university and that obviously turned out terrible. I have so many personality issues and find it hard to properly socialize with anyone. I got into med school in another city expecting to finally start living a normal life and having my basic rights. All those promises my family had made that they would finally let me be free or the things they are going to get me if I get into med school but suddenly my rich narc family stopped paying for my basic needs like even enough to buy proper food! Or to pay for my taxi! Let alone hanging out with friends or getting a girlfriend. They said money will spoil you! You will get busy with girls and not finish your studies!!

I invested so much into the relationship, constantly dealing with emotional abuse from her, constant suicide threats (she actually attempted it at one point and I managed to stop it), supported her with her counselling sessions, and generally tried my absolute best to make her happy. I did not realise how much my depression had creeped back up on my as I was too focused on trying to make her better. My grandad passed away a few months before the breakup, which exasperated everything, and I was reaching out for support from her that just was not there. After the breakup I have sunk to the lowest I have ever been in my entire life, I was hospitalised last week after coming close to the edge (quite literally) but the suicidal thoughts are still in the back of my mind. The point is, I know that the relationship was not healthy for me, but I cannot let go, its like she took half of me with her when she split, leaving a she will of what I used to be. I am trying so hard to keep it together for the sake of my family but I simply cannot let go of the longing for her back, which I know is crazy after everything she is done.

It started with little things; I would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than I ordinarily would. \\n\\nEventually, it escalated to the point where I would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians. And if I did circle a block, usually there would be OTHER potholes or bumps, which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me, quite literally, to insanity. It was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation.\\n\\nAfter beginning medication, this generally subsided to a manageable level, and with CBT I was doing pretty good. Then, in December of 2022, my wife and I were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an F350 who rear ended us, travelling at roughly 80 KMh. He ran from the incident. Everyone was miraculously not seriously injured, but I’ve been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving. \\n\\nThis hyper-vigilance (I drive quite a bit) has now lead to significant physical illness for me. From stress, I’ve ground my molars to completely flat, and the tension within my body from being so, braced? I guess? And overly vigilant while driving, is really locking me up. I’ve gained a lot of weight, too. It’s lead to serious depression as I’ve built a life that requires me to have a limber body.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any similar stories to share? Or even just some relevant encouragement… I’m really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this.\\n\\nThank you beautiful humans, please drive safe and treat yourself gently.\",\"Anxiety\"],[\"Lit a candle, I think heat fumes hit my eye.

The more I change that right now, the easier it will be to change that for future me.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo starting right now I’m going to:\\n\\n1. **STOP GOOGLING (and body checks).**  My doctor once told me I have “googleitis” and the best and only cure was to just stop.  Helpful advice there.    \\nObviously go to your doctor if you're worried about something, and by all means, get a second opinion if you're still concerned.  Beyond that, leave it to the professionals to diagnose.  \\n2. **Stop seeking reassurance for every symptom.**  I know what people are going to say to me.  “You’re fine”, “Statistically that only has a 0.00001% chance”, “breathe deeply”.  I can do this for myself.  I can be kind and firm with my own mind.  \\n3. **Stop asking “what if”**.  Things can and will happen.  Worrying about the future will never help.  We can only live our best lives now, and take life as it comes.\\n4. **Actually acknowledge statistics.**  Next time I feel a symptom I’m going to ask myself “what’s the most likely cause?”  Pretty much any symptom can be better attributed to harmless things like lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much anxious thinking, and so on.\\n5. **Recognize and challenge maladaptive thought patterns.** The more I think in anxious ways, the more my brain will automatically go back to those patterns.  Time to see those thoughts for what they are: unrealistic beliefs and fears.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI know anxiety is going to get worse at the start, but I can handle that.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI can do this.

I have had many issues with fatigue in the past, and they were really terrifying. I've come to develop some kind of PTSD with exercise and exertions.. A few weeks ago I just went to grab some groceries and the exertion from carrying the weight had me suffering in the evening with widespread body pains and an intense fatigue that signalled there was something wrong with my body. In any case, I came down with a cough after that so my doctor said I could be coming down with a cold or something, and if exertions make me tired I shouldn't exercise and I should rest. \\n\\nIt's been 2 weeks, I still don't know when it's safe to start moving because I'm still coughing slightly and seem to be coming down with sore throat.

I went to several doctors, all of which said I was healthy. I finally worked up the courage to go to a neurologist and upon seeing how anxious I was, she gave me a brain MRI. \\n\\nIt turns out that I had an incidental finding which was “benign brain calcification”. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed “normal”. \\n\\nI had another CT a year later, and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate I’ve just had it my whole life and means nothing, and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away (which would be next year or the year after). They did say that if I’m having symptoms such as a headache (they gave no other symptoms), that we can schedule it sooner. \\n\\nI’m just terrified that it’s multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms, especially with vision. I’m just nervous that it’s the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. \\n\\nHas anyone else had experience with this? Or any doctors that can give me some reassurance?

Please check this out. My heart goes out to all of you experiencing this. It is crippling and mental torture when it gets out of hand and it feels like it has so much control over you. The world definitely puts enough things out there to scare us, but not enough to comfort us and assuage our fears. There is definitely a lack of balance and it's so frustrating because mental health is SO important. Anxiety can make you feel like you are going crazy and to me, that is the scariest and most deeply troubling symptom. The feeling that I can't trust my mind\\u002fmyself and that I've lost who I am completely and I'll never be the same. That's what fear and anxiety can do to you when not properly addressed! That being said, after WEEKS of constantly- and I mean CONSTANTLY- searching on google for self-help, I have FINALLY found a resource that is starting to help me. Most of the resources I've found only scratch the surface and are really tailored to mild anxiety- they don't really help. I am only on the second module, but this is the most helpful source I have found for this illness and I am hopeful that I will get better. Please please pleaseeeee at least look at this.

It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms.

[Long post] In October of 2017, I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from, but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then, I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24\\u002f7, so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs\\u002fEKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times, with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years, which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke, drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through, but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely, but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria\\u002fhealth illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason, it was like a complete 180, from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.\\n\\nLately, I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that, but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example: about two nights ago, I was getting ready to take a nap, but I was on my phone for a few, getting settled, propping myself with my right hand\\u002farm on my side. Later, I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after, but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured, \\\"I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap\\\". Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten better, I think. Fine, whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm, closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up, my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and light-headed and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible - I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes \\\"severe\\\" and should seek help, etc. Granted this was just all on the same page, but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water, but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body, I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain, or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas, I could easily reason with myself.\\n\\nI haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do, as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression.

I just really wanted to let this all out and I figured this is the best place to do it.\\n\\nI've always had a little bit of health anxiety, but it typically subsided very quickly. It was never something that had an effect on my life until recently.\\n\\nOne night in early December I was playing a video game for several hours and barely moved. Eventually I had a pain shooting up my left leg and it appeared to be swollen. My mom suggested I pinched a nerve, but I just knew it was a blood clot. My symptoms were a mild pain in my leg and \\\"swelling\\\", Google told me I was about to die, and I was thoroughly convinced.\\n\\nA few days pass of me obsessing over this. I read about DVT for hours every single day. I'm basically an expert on it at this point. I know all about taking blood thinners and the effect it could have on your period. I was preparing myself for this life.\\n\\nI measured my legs to compare them many times a day. This had me believing the \\\"swelling\\\" wasn't going down. Turns out the left side of me is just fatter than the other half and I never noticed it because the difference is literally less than a cm. Was I *ever* swelling? No idea. My mom measured her own legs to show me a difference in the size of your legs was normal, which only kind of comforted me. Briefly wondered if she too was dying and didn't know it.\\n\\nSomewhere around this time I thought I had sleep apnea because one night my anxiety was so bad that I was jolting awake every time I started dozing off. This fear faded pretty quickly since my obvious blood clot was my biggest priority.\\n\\nAfter those few days passed, my anxiety finally won the battle, and I went to the ER. Shocking news: I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I thought this confirmation would make me feel better, and it did for a few days. But my (mild, barely noticeable) leg pain persisted and after all my DVT research I decided I was among the extremely rare few who had an inaccurate ultrasound reading.\\n\\n6 days after the first ER visit, I had an excruciating muscle spasm in my leg. Surely the blood clot has moved up into my thigh, I thought. This was accompanied by my lower back feeling like it was on fire and the fiery pain radiating down into my leg. My mom once again suggested a pinched nerve. I was in hysterics at this point so I ignored her and went back to the ER.\\n\\nThey did another ultrasound. It was negative. I had sciatica. Started googling that to make sure it could cause the symptoms I had (it can). The pain was goddamn miserable, but I wasn't going to die.\\n\\nYou'd think at this point I'd be good, but my mind had other plans. I developed a cough. Welp, the blood clot was real and must have traveled to my lungs. I'm dealing with a pulmonary embolism now and death is imminent. I believed this for a few days before finally accepting that it was fucking ridiculous.\\n\\nSo after about 3 weeks of this hell I finally moved on from my blood clot obsession and just focused on healing the sciatica. Had a nice 2 weeks or so of feeling like I was back to normal mentally, until this week.\\n\\nI had a pain in my lower abdomen. Convinced myself it was a kidney infection. Didn't start off assuming a mostly harmless UTI (or literally any of the many other things that could cause abdominal pain), nah, I went right for the hard hitter. This one could kill me, it's gotta be that one. I considered appendicitis too.\\n\\nIt was constipation.\\n\\nI was hopeful that my life would go back to normal after the whole blood clot disaster, but now I'm worried that it was just the beginning. I *knew* I was being ridiculous when I diagnosed myself with a kidney infection, but there was still that voice in the back of my head saying \\\"but what if...\\\".

So the next Tuesday I went to my primary care doctor for a follow up to check my potassium level, and on the way I began to get that tingling and pressure in my chest again, I pulled over, got something to drink, and made it to the doctors office. Potassium came back fine. The feeling didn’t go away. All the rest of that day I felt like I couldn’t breathe. The next day I went to a minor emergency center and after even more tests on my heart lungs and veins, they concluded that I was fine and it was probably just anxiety. 3 days later. Went to the ER because the feeling still hasn’t gone away and it is getting hard to live my life. Same thing, a bunch of tests and concluded nothing. Doctor said it might be a ulcer in my stomach and put me on medication. One week later and it only got worse. I went back to the ER and they took even more extensive tests and still found nothing. I was desperate to feel better, it had been two weeks of constant suffering. I went back to my primary doctor and he ordered more tests and a copy of the results from the ER. He found what appeared to be a “hiatus hernia” in my stomach and gave me a acid reducer. It has gotten better but still hasn’t gone away. It has been almost two months since that Tuesday and I haven’t gotten even one minute of relief. My heart pounds constantly, my stomach bloats, I’m always cold, I have pain in my chest, I can’t take a deep breath, and I’m always tired. I feel like if someone can’t help me I’m going to die.

A few days later I lay down to go to bed and I start feeling cold, my heart starts pounding, and I get scared and start googling.

I've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while, but doctors I've seen haven't been concerned because I weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck -- an ENT basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. It's only one one side. During my appointment with the ENT though, I insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. She agreed, but said it could be caused by a ton of things. My cheek is a bit swollen on the inside, too. It's most notable right under my ear lobe, resting on my jaw. It feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face.\\n\\nShe referred me for an MRI with contrast, and suggested I cancel a sonogram I had scheduled because an MRI would be better, anyway (I did.) I haven't had that yet, but I'm really freaked out and wondering if there's anything else I should be concerned with or if I should take her advice to just chill. I've had ulcers on that side of the mouth before (12 at a time, two years ago, apparently caused by stress), I wore clear retainers for two years that could have caused swelling and I had impacted wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. They were more impacted on that side of my mouth. I'm not sure what to do, just wondering if I'm going crazy or if I'm right to be concerned.

That left and I was left with a near constant rumbling feeling in my intestines so I start to imagine it's IBS.

Once I wake up and get ready for the day I leave and go to my moms. If she has something to do I’ll go visit my aunt. If she has something to do I’ll go visit a friend, so on and so forth. It is an avoidant tactic so I don’t have to take care of things (cleaning, responding to mail, etc.) I also know I do this because I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts, or make a poor decision, like spending money or killing myself. \\n\\nAs I’m typing this it seems like a healthy coping mechanism, but it drives me absolutely mad that I can’t just take care of my shit. \\n\\nDoes anyone else do this?

I've struggled with Bipolar Disorder for years. I'm almost 20, and I notice a lot that I end up sleep talking. I've had a couple occasions where I wake up in the middle of the night and I start having a conversation with one of my friends, just like I would do at any other point in the day. I would feel like my friend is sitting in the chair in the corner of my room just having a conversation with me in the dark, and I will wake up and talk for a couple of minutes (what it seems like at least) before I seem to pull out of it and freak out a little when I realize that it wasn't real.\\n\\nIt gets WAY worse when my boyfriend sleeps over at my apartment. When I used to stay at my ex's house as well, I remember sleep-talking over there.\\n\\nWhen my boyfriend slept over last week, I had at least 4 instances within the night of tossing and turning where I started having nightmares, and then talking through them. There were a couple points in the night where I \\\"woke up\\\" and shook my boyfriend on the shoulder and started talking to him like he was my old best friend Shelby. I began talking to \\\"Shelby\\\" about how our friendship had been on the rocks but we should try and be best friends again. He was mostly sound asleep and wrapped his arms around me and I remember thinking \\\"Oh, that's not Shelby\\\" right before I fell back into a short, but deep sleep.\\n\\nIt happened with another nightmare that same night, I woke up crying and saying \\\"I don't know why you would do this, why did you have to do that? Why did you cheat on me? You know loyalty is so important to me,\\\" because in my dream I guess my boyfriend had been unfaithful or something, and I was in the in-between of asleep and awake and I started lecturing my very-faithful boyfriend on why he dream-cheated on me (lol). But after a minute of talking to him (he's a heavy sleeper, so he didn't really fully listen right away to what I was saying), I snap out of it almost every time, even just a little bit and realize that I wasn't actually having a convo with anyone.\\n\\nIt's a really bizarre scenario, and it's happened a few times.\\n\\nAnother one I can specifically think of included sleep walking and sleep talking at my ex's house. I started having a full-on conversation at 3 am after having been sound asleep, and I started talking about how I wanted to watch the movie School of Rock (idk why haha). \\n\\nIt's hard because it's not a full-on sleeptalking I don't think. I have a weird experience where in the moment, I am aware that I am having a conversation, even though I think my body is about 10% aware that the people I am talking to are just from my dreams. It's so strange. I'm sorry if this is confusing, but if anyone has any experience with intense &amp; regular sleep-talking, please do share!!\",\"Bipolar\"],[\"Overwhelming sense of death I have this overwhelming sense that I'm going to die soon.

I can't find the right medication. I'm gaining weight from my new one and can't stop eating. I got fired from my one job after being in the hospital. I'm failing half of my classes at college. I feel like because of my bipolar I'm just not made to be successful in life. I haven't been stable since early highschool. I'm so tired of rapid cycling and my moods shifting so fucking fast. I always used to say that I didn't want to live past 22, but that was even before my diagnosis. I can only see my life becoming more hopeless and I feel bad for my partner of almost a year that puts up with my bullshit. My mom says I wallow in self pity a lot and there's people worse off than me but how is that supposed to help me? I don't want to end up being on disability for the rest of my life, I don't want to drop out of school because of this fucking disorder. But it just doesn't seem to end. \",\"Bipolar\"],[\"Good news!

From there on it was a whirlwind of seeing different psychiatrists and receiving different diagnoses. 2 years later it was agreed that I had bipolar II and I was put on medication and sent to therapy. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm not sure how medication worked for me, I was prescribed some mood-stabilisers and I took them, and after I was asked how they work for me I said yeah, they are great, despite not feeling any difference at all. Therapy didn't help me either, I'm a self-diagnosed compulsive liar and therapy did nothing for me because I just lied to my therapist about a bunch of trivial things, so I never allowed her to get close. I think I lie mostly because I don't like people getting to know too much about me and my life, though often I also just lie for no reason at all. I'm not a sociopath or psychopath, I do experience emotions very much and sometimes I get angry at myself for lying to people I care about. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor some reason, at some point when I was 17 I just could not manage to call my psychiatrist nor my therapist for another appointment. My mother, who is a supportive and kind person normally, who however always stigmatised and made fun of me for mental health issues (despite having some herself), refused to call them for me on the basis that I'm 17, I should be able to do this for myself now.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I never went back to my psychiatrist and that meant no more pharmacy recipes for my medication. That's how I uncontrolledly went off my mood-stabilisers. It was a whirlwind and it pushed me right back to the start of my problems. Don't do this. This is stupid and dangerous and not recommended by ANYBODY.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSince then I have learned to control myself better and I have learned coping methods that help me. I still know I am going through phases of depression and hypomania and rapid-cycling. I am learning methods that help me push through it. I believe I'm at a point in my life where I have the will and drive to get help and medication again, but I try to cope. I'm turning 21 soon and currently enrolled half-time at an online university. I study in English, which is not my native language, but I enjoy it very much and it's a field I am very very interested in. I have a boyfriend who is older than me and financially supports me. I am a supportive family that I could always come back to running, if I dropped out of university it would not be the end of the world. Even though I dropped out of high school right before graduation (because I stood no chance at ever passing the math final) I could get a job and not worry about money, thanks to my family's circumstances.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow I mostly suffer from the 'side effect' symptoms of BP II, (as I like to call them): delusions, emotional intensity, binging on various things and irritability. I sometimes get bouts of feelings of guilt for things that are long done with, or just for no reason. I feel highly emotional about wasting food, money, other things. Which can be a challenge when you experience hypomania sometimes, lol.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you for reading if you came this far, I hope you're coping well.

Also looking for health insurance Hi,\\n\\nI recently have started on the journey to get some help. And new to this sub. I've been reading but to scared to put myself out there.\\n\\nI don't know if I'm bipolar. I've done a bunch of research and I believe I can trace manic highs and depressed lows as far back as very in early in life... I'm 28 now. The last 4 full \\\"swings\\\" as I call them took about 4 and a half to 5 years to run their course. They gotten more pronounced as I started adulthood. This last one landed me a 3 month mania build up with full blown mania for about a month (I wish I could explain this part better... All I can say is that I was not myself and I was pretty delusional about what I could and couldn't accomplish... Sleeping three or four hours every day or two and trying to do everything) and then one of the hardest depressions I've ever experienced for roughly four or five months (suicidal thoughts, complete isolation from everyone and everything including work, weight gain of about 70 pounds, increased self loathing).\\n\\nI'm also a complete fuck up in life. So maybe that's a consideration. This last time, the catalyst for my swing was believing I could do a new job, and then eventually hiding from it because I couldn't carry some of the tasks out due to anxiety.\\n\\nI guess I wanted to give out some info since I see a lot of you guys share yourselves openly... And maybe vent, too.\\n\\nSo two days ago was tough. And I've been thinking and thinking about trying to get help, but the farthest I've gotten is two therapy sessions with someone I really didn't hit it off with. \\n\\nSo after having a shitty wave of self hatred that day, I decided to call around again. I found a practice with a therapist and psychiatrist. I went through the process of setting up an appointment to first see the therapist and then the psychiatrist.\\n\\nI don't have health insurance. \\n\\nIt's a steep bill, but I can pay it. \\n\\nAs a side note, before I tried the new job, I landed myself a decent paying job that is also self employed so I can take days or even weeks off without too many reprocussions. I've done that going on 6 years. It's very difficult to explain but I developed a skill at this job and I could do it the rest of my life if I wanted. But because it is set up the way it is, it doesn't give me health insurance, retirement, or any benefits you might find at other jobs.\\n\\nI figured if I was going to shell out a wad of cash to self pay for trying to get help (and ongoing therapy if it's recommended), I should look at just self paying for insurance.\\n\\nI just don't know where to start so I don't get health insurance sales calls. I didn't even know those existed. I was called almost 20 times in 6-8 hours. Fuck maybe more.

Physically and mentally I made a full recovery by May 2022, my ex of 7 years cheated on me in June and I surprisingly dealt with it really well. I’d been off work March-September due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again, I dealt with it well. I returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the office. I’m a confident bloke but I was nervous AF! I spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me, fast forward a few hours later and she’d requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting. We met shortly after for a date and it was like we’d know each other years, best date ever. From this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally. The connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal. I asked her to be my girlfriend in October and she was genuinely excited about it, this made me realise I’d found someone special. Shortly after this I had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till January, she was my rock, my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. I’m 29 and I’ve cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term. I thought I was incapable but this woman changed that and she’s the first I’ve ever loved, and hopefully the last. On 02\\u002f01\\u002f23 the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news. From this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably, nothing too rapid. 05\\u002f01\\u002f23 I went over to my Nan’s house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day. I walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor, this was the day I deteriorated rapidly. I needed my girlfriend desperately for support but I was just far too much to deal with. I wasn’t just depressed, this time it was different. I was awake 4-8 days regularly and would only sleep when I’d black out. I was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head. Because it was my girlfriend who had become distant I stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much I love her. She wasn’t leaving me she just needed space and I could cope on my own. 20\\u002f02\\u002f23 2 men tried to steal my car and I managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process. I was hit 11 times with a knuckle duster and 40+ times by the other bloke with just his fists. I was left with 4 skull fractures, fractured orbital bone, broken nose and broke jaw. I’m an ex professional Muay Thai fighter so I’m used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different, although I now have slurred speech, blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally. I started to have panic attacks and I was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis. Again I continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away, shortly after this she ended things. She made the right decision because I was horrendous and I was dragging her down. This present day I’m on the mend now and I barely remember any of it, the days all merged as one. It feels like someone else has been living\\u002fwrecking my life and last week I woke up and have been given it back. I’m now trying to fix all the damage I’ve caused, I’ve lost most of my friends, family and the love of my life. I’ll never give up on her but for now I can only love her from a distance. I hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but I also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before.

I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.\\n\\nHow does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.\\n\\nI have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking\\u002fwriting “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\\\\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\\\\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.\\n\\nAnxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive. \\n\\nDo my friends love me? -that’s what I’m stressing about as I type this-.\",\"Bipolar\"],[\"Zero sex drive while hypomanic It's the only symptom I don't experience with hypomania.

I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said, everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. \\n\\nIt turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here, so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. \\n\\nI now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that, but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia.

I tried to get help a few\\ntimes, but symptoms would pass by the time I got an appointment, or\\ndidn't seem serious enough. I had a manic episode in 2015. I was\\nhospitalized and then later went to an outpatients psychosis response\\nservice. Was put on Olanzapine. Later I was put on fluoxetine. After a\\nwhile I came off olanzapine and have only been on fluoxetine\\nsince 2016. I also quit drinking in 2016. All that helped and I have\\nbeen sober\\u002fstable for over 3 years now.\\n\\nOne thing I've noticed since my psychotic episode is it's been really\\nhard to make friends. I haven't made any new friends since then, and\\nI've drifted away from the ones I have. Part of this is just getting\\nolder (I'm 29), but I've noticed when I do meet people I would\\npotentially care about, I'm just not that invested. I'm also slightly\\nfatigued the whole time. The fatigue doesn't affect me when I'm cycle\\ntouring, but then we're talking 8+ hours of hard activity a day. I\\ncan't possibly do that every day as a software developer. I cycle\\nevery day commuting for about an hour and a half, so I'm not inactive.\\n\\nI don't have much ambition any more and it really feels like life is \\npassing me by. One of the most noticeable things about this is that \\nwhen I was actively bipolar I would be fixated on people. I was in \\nlove with someone I'd say continuously for 9 years (not the same \\nperson). But now I haven't really been attracted to anyone since I was \\ntreated. Obviously the previous thing wasn't healthy; but nowadays I \\ntry to date but I just don't develop any attachment to them. I'd say \\nit's lack of sex drive, but it's broader than that because I'm also \\nlike this with potential new platonic friends. It'd be great to have\\nsomething in the middle.\\n\\nI'm not sure how to approach this. I've been thinking it may be the \\nchange of being sober and treated along with the trauma of having had \\nsuch a serious episode; but alongside that I've been wondering if it's \\nsomething more basic like emotional blunting from fluoxetine, so I'm \\nthinking of talking to my doctor; but she's a GP and I don't have a \\ndedicated psychiatrist any more. Counselling is really expensive and I \\nused to just get it on the NHS. Not sure how to approach looking for \\nit myself.

She put me on prozac and seroquel but didn’t give me a bipolar dx just left it as historical. I was doing okay and moved in with my Aunt in Texas and had about two weeks where i went off the seroquel bc i couldn’t get it refilled. I stopped sleeping again and was just generally euphoric.

medication while pregnant and if it was okay, or if you went off and how it went for you? and how you felt after you gave birth, because i’m scared of having bad postpartum depression or postpartum mania. i know there’s nothing you can really do to prevent it, but if anyone has any tips or advice on anything or even just being a parent with bipolar, i would love to hear from you and your experiences!\",\"Bipolar\"]],\"hovertemplate\":\"status=%{customdata[1]}\\u003cbr\\u003ePC1=%{x:.3f}\\u003cbr\\u003ePC2=%{y:.3f}\\u003cbr\\u003ePC3=%{z:.3f}\\u003cbr\\u003estatement=%{customdata[0]}\\u003cextra\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fextra\\u003e\",\"legendgroup\":\"Bipolar\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#FFA15A\",\"opacity\":0.85,\"symbol\":\"circle\"},\"mode\":\"markers\",\"name\":\"Bipolar\",\"scene\":\"scene\",\"showlegend\":true,\"x\":[0.18708356084609218,-0.04714421510679839,0.047804697421189334,0.048903811251896474,0.10220442885391176,0.3898313343099029,-0.09411005556413748,0.2997623563438284,0.1322346583742189,-0.050515218385034304,-0.05892925390699902,0.004966734308038621,0.13102515413870575,0.26512427945664885,-0.011133566460281831,0.02819024256791393,-0.048425434902795994,0.3027623839650578,0.055024760038234456,0.2668710919461104,-0.1070474217333521,0.17606520480088875,0.018951525621265054,0.32868017727862486,0.15468040127827123,-0.007920482753165668,0.13959339298616005,0.256133080893114,0.12073836631534667,0.18204263097497866,0.17318765613921194,0.07314443722485428,0.2592910222129504,0.0008758038200971528,0.24751474191188358,-0.07113441069822317,-0.018469588090243124,-0.12851402849618904,0.02088587821264846,0.3268880943109536,0.1093238513686119,0.3872753935244456,0.28746948087248875,0.2211539447729071,0.17078262122828158,0.12326899360090392,0.16858634361949767,-0.13920753122685864,0.22700255000028027,0.16182535814382468,0.19238618521781448,0.21807475971378346,0.06110332512135637,0.30753187942465166,0.1160305534534403,0.33025768438134157,0.21812864787736685,0.19295989300005986,-0.17459054229562992,-0.006384917958063045,0.3139723419306441,0.03692808785323258,0.11710995561122309,0.03294391537154794,0.06379972065437767,0.23899336297981574,0.12226556766992021,0.060272367333849323,0.2242829573230213,0.0956089862003629,0.05719709279508239,0.190913909709039,0.13295891324161033,0.06774344199809752,0.1960478692453864,0.20234177547891943,0.04190537118735363,0.13517593933780295,-0.059473142808902923,0.01859521778470384,0.02945335062405022,0.208013471305269,0.0067678101346773725,0.17263030439566535,0.3355862103067974,0.03687431606160982,0.1933838008313254,0.047924938519578776,0.2649019422525719,-0.2115373923178213,0.34295482967950336,0.23010592008495662,-0.09708941578692812,0.15819435216946895,0.05645241124625495,0.24149742561882742,-0.07113441069822317,0.17270761557024894,0.20874327225122863,0.22837983720767532,-0.10421653885944107,0.1309275148986484,0.3292117688341922,-0.04490036690029212,0.13818954682287302,-0.0523325749844593,-0.009709994055534145,0.23181434910514384,0.16736344169714817,0.06890357340069596,0.21393781758341995,0.039277864974223045,0.043903216249147614,0.10197482967333873,0.28920965171355123,0.12555111607735198,0.01138192578348215,0.1672220938345043,-0.08619745373772887,-0.037605979039343755,-0.04846931578965611,0.08127071654778638,0.3149479759717484,0.3354022675359373,0.3618620911432755,0.056340324279553655,0.32623992995717355,0.07656487432921164],\"y\":[-0.07831842053276941,-0.36858665624647546,-0.23806860150187423,-0.2503408632240911,-0.06168636713624006,0.010856332609767535,-0.27147330259267816,-0.1969111708562277,-0.23064397973216746,-0.2536445156376057,-0.30279809230734384,-0.4173398340812939,-0.09780105225005667,-0.06828367302774196,-0.21153425384609145,-0.30003126988015866,-0.2589565910242945,0.12371019773859311,-0.2955643032298179,-0.20404692308910544,-0.25829070430441764,-0.28357959369000824,-0.054648878083639676,-0.05737479770549653,-0.16650824695827934,-0.3498948540256935,-0.4494610406392577,-0.2944490422589368,-0.33181085991784637,-0.004497936163497971,-0.09354391285040288,-0.3872192206535343,-0.188994172538917,-0.22319388093801568,0.22406132824426628,0.008163091901998456,-0.0652793316883963,-0.28766157631411976,-0.31838487736712096,-0.1594800188478506,-0.3046929308178743,-0.10292232210308512,-0.18936177205819033,-0.2247646505579058,-0.2052047849996331,-0.3625500928385585,-0.34234102361716734,-0.345937058625228,-0.13199535929416498,-0.36795431531152645,-0.29224598284411957,-0.26142716234679675,-0.2298102481230119,-0.19381985749561756,-0.4470132785223627,-0.018270022969560325,0.005154426689316273,-0.3322292926675275,-0.39903644206026867,-0.3442534402828592,-0.30561773279690163,-0.12725899555275272,-0.19162417971370008,-0.24014255000222612,-0.2585842102048711,-0.18920296123408045,-0.06764766131644273,-0.2390974967071744,-0.31219394552592333,-0.33884669388296496,-0.3155708114748912,-0.2345852312375267,-0.2805576671026849,-0.3373726752041457,-0.21678919635250768,-0.3549425314284295,-0.1475499780170331,-0.22471339802188142,-0.3712144474039921,-0.12013172621968565,-0.34455036088749624,-0.14592846490056452,-0.350709630679898,-0.3647442255568856,-0.025584224079682406,-0.1448373122903344,-0.23938982640648993,-0.0897934598970234,-0.07993385573221375,-0.12593453639556693,-0.06800767785135654,-0.1966314113388638,-0.18315835605956174,-0.17778660799555115,-0.23850354290346595,-0.04981602970685842,0

I took my break and paced around outside debating if I should call in my FMLA and leave work but when I came back something very small and stupid happened that set me off. I blew up on my group leader screaming at her that I can't fucking do this! Even though I hate GM she is the nicest lady and easily the best boss I have ever had and I feel like a complete scumbag. She tried to fire me and the union got it down to a suspension but I honestly couldn't feel worse if I had been fired. I'm so ashamed of myself for how I acted and have been in a deep depression for the last few days and haven't done much more than lay in bed crying. The worst part is that she thinks I did it because I was mad about the write up and thought I could bully her because she is a woman and week, apparently she has faced discrimination in previous jobs. I hate myself, I'm ashamed of myself, and even though I didn't get fired I feel like nothing will ever be ok again.\",\"Stress\"],[\"I legitimately do not know anyone who has survived this, and I feel like i'm not even human any more.

I didn’t tell her to, but I did tell her that it hurts me that she would engage with people who apparently have so many negative things to say about me, and I thought blood was thicker than water. Really it’s her callous “yea I see you’re in pain but I don’t care, get over it” type of standpoint that’s hurting me the most.

Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8\\\", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.\",\"Stress\"],[\"It's always been something I have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety.

I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas, I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink, well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos, my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans, I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is, pour some in the grinder to make sure.\\n\\nWas it expensive? Well, getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there, it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes, mochas, I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests, I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process, satisfaction in these product, and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy, but friends and family can as well.\\n\\nMy advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring, there's plenty of resources. If you like writing, maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit.

I have a job that I hate, it’s my first job, it’s a 9-5 in a high pace high stress environment and when I make a mistake it has an effect - and of course I do make mistakes. My coworker also treats me like a personal assistant and delegates all of her last minute jobs to do immediately without thanks which is so stressful as I can never complete a project on time because of it.

I look heavier than I am, I get a lot of exercise (10K steps minimum daily plus cardio focussed gym 2-5 times a week depending how tired i am) and do not over eat, if anything (tw) I probably under eat by a long way because I lose my appetite and forget to eat. It’s just bizarre to me and it’s not that I want to be thinner but I know that with my lifestyle I ought to be a lot thinner than I am so I’ve no clue what the reasoning for that is. My psoriasis is getting worse. It used to be a small patch on my leg but now I’ve got it on my lips, cheeks, back and it’s spreading down my arm. I was researching self soothing and I do that obsessively, I bite my lips to oblivion and crack my knuckles to the point where they hurt. I am ALWAYS tired even if I get 14 hours of sleep, luckily my insomnia has gone away for the time being but that used to be really bad too. I also get migraines the second I begin to relax. If it’s not pretty obvious ill just throw in that I have been diagnosed with anxiety. My doctor doesn’t want to help and there’s no free therapy in my area as there’s massive wait lists for everything. So I’m on here hoping to find someone who might relate. Can this all be due to stress? Do you have any advice? My job contract ends soon and I’m not renewing it don’t worry but I know any entry level job will be just as intense so how can I manage it and minimise these symptoms?

Below are given some ways you can overcome your stress.\\n\\n**EASY TIPS TO MANAGE STRESS**\\n\\nEvery individual has their own style of dealing with stress. However, there are basic guidelines for dealing with stress. Here they are-\\n\\n* **Reframe** the stressor to see a whole new picture.\\n\\nDuring a stressful situation explain the situation on a lighter note to yourself. Remind yourself to see life as continuous learning. Look at the positive side!\\n\\n* Failure is a stepping stone to success.\\n* You failed so what?

Could there be another way to look at this situation?.\\n\\n* **Manage your time**. Stress is managed by simply planning your day well in advance. Like maintaining a weekly planner with all the deadlines, meetings, appointments, family time and most importantly don’t forget to throw some ‘**me time’** in there too.\\n* You **can’t control everything**.\\n\\nLearn to let go of things over which you don’t have a control.

I'm pretty much completely alone. My family is mostly dead and the rest no contact. I'm f(42) divorced, no kids, and I just ended a three year post marriage relationship that was pretty toxic. \\n\\nI have two best friends since High School. We've known each other over 25 years and we used to be inseparable. (We all had family issues so we became our own family.) They both moved out of state at least 15 years ago so the majority of our friendship is on the phone and we maybe visit each other once or twice a year. \\n\\nMy last relationship which lasted three years, really got in the way of our friendships. My boyfriend was so clingy I could never call my friends because he wouldn't leave me alone for a minute. (That's a whole other unhealthy issue I can't get into. Lol).  But as an avoidant person it drove me crazy. Anytime I had the chance to be alone without my boyfriend the last thing I wanted to do was call my friends. I needed alone time. \\n\\nI did try to break up with him several times. He even moved out a few times but kept coming back. I finally broke up with him for good about six months ago. \\n\\nAnyway, I understand why they are reluctant to just go back to the way things were in our friendship. I don't blame them for being upset with me and I fully plan to try my best to make it up to them and I'm grateful that they are willing to talk to me at all but... I'm not sure I like them anymore. \\n\\nWe've been friends for so long. I seriously don't have anyone else in my life and I am afraid I am just doing the avoidant thing and looking for reasons to write them out of my life. I've done that with everyone else in my life but these two always seemed special and I feel like we've known each other so long they are family and I want to always know them but they aren't really being good friends anymore. \\n\\nI know people grow apart and I admit that I am the one who stopped talking as much initially and like I said I was and am more than prepared to make up to them the fact that I haven't been around but honestly I wasn't around because I was in a toxic relationship and I told them that every time I did get a chance to talk to them. I talked about how I was stuck for financial reasons and covid and that I was losing my mind to never be alone and they didn't help me. They didn't encourage me to get out or give me advice they just got more and more distant and now that I am broken up they tell me this guy was bad for me but they wouldn't tell me that when we were together and that's what I needed to hear from them. Instead they just acted like they liked my bf and talked bad about both of us to each other. I hate to say but it almost feels like they were enjoying me being in a bad relationship. Maybe I'm just paranoid. \\n\\nThey say they forgive me but they don't talk to me very much. One really doesn't call me or answer me and the other calls all the time but I'm not allowed to talk about my relationship at all. He has hung up on me twice for even mentioning it. I get that he doesn't like my ex but neither do I and I was in a toxic relationship for three years, I need to talk some of it through. I would never do that to them and god knows I have had to listen to some boring and\\u002for stupid problems of theirs repeatedly over the years. Why can't they do that for me?\\n\\nI know people out grow each other. They have made new friends and I need to as well but it's hard for me because  well, I have avpd. \\n\\nIdeally, I would like to keep them as friends and make new friends that understand more about the person I am now instead of the person I was in high school. But the part of me that pushes people away wants to push them out and I don't know what to do?\\n\\nDo they get to treat me bad because I wasn't as accessible to them for a while? I was never completely gone I just couldn't be there as much. Do they get points for being friends with me so long? Should I just over look it?\\n\\nOr am I right that they are being disrespectful by telling me what I can or can't talk about, hanging up on me if I mention something they don't like, talking to each other and excluding me even if they are talking about coming into town and staying with me even when they are not invited? I have to work and they are on vacation but please come stay at my house and expect me to drop everything to do what you want? (We never do what I want when they come to visit because I live here so I have to be on board to do everything they want to do.)\\n\\nI know it's a long story. There is a lot more to it too but am I blowing things out of proportion and prematurely ending my longest and only friendships ? Or has the time apart from them given me clarity to see who they really are which is bossy and disrespectful of me and I should just try and make new friends that don't judge me so harshly, like talking and listening to me, and actually live in my town? \\nTLDR: I have had a hard life and I want to stand up for myself.

If someone reached out to me and said something along the lines of struggling with personal things, that would be so helpful even if much time has passed. The people who you have ghosted are probably hurt and confused, and the truth is they probably internalized it as something THEY have said or done wrong. If they did not do anything wrong, that is something to highlight.\\n\\n\\\"Hi. I just wanted you to know that I have been struggling with some personal things, and that's why I haven't reached out. I am still struggling and not ready to maintain friendships just yet. But I do want to let you know I care. I'm sorry if I have left you hurt and confused. It was not something you have done wrong.\\\" I am not in a place to explain further, but I do hope you are well.\\\"\\n\\nSome people may be understanding, and some people may still be reeling from the hurt and not respond at all, or they may decide that they do not want to open the door back up to having contact with you now or in the future because they felt that they were rejected and don't want to risk that again. Rejection hurts people without mental illness, too! That is not necessarily a rejection of you, but more of a reflection of the place where they're at mentally. It may have taken them a while to move on from the relationship\\u002ffriendship. Some people may feel that keeping that door closed is protecting them from getting hurt again. In my opinion, that is more than a fair response so before you do reach out if you decide to, you have to mentally prepare for whatever decision someone will make. One way to look at it is you get the chance to prepare for their response when they never got a chance to prepare for being ghosted (unless you let them know you ghost at times).\",\"Personality disorder\"],[\"I'm not sure lol Everything kinda just hurts and am sad for some reason??😭😭😭😂 But I'm literally not sure or why but literally no one cares😭😭😭 but not really sad\",\"Personality disorder\"],[\"Anyone else have trouble verbalizing their thoughts and feelings?

You just watch all these years go by, one after another, as you unwillingly stay alone and sabotage your relationship potential with others.  It's like standing stationary on a train station platform, and just watching the trains of life pass you by, year after year, but you are too terrified to ever get into any of the trains. Anyone else feels the same? That's how I can describe it\",\"Personality disorder\"],[\"Motivation Maybe I'm just pathetic, but I feel like I need someone in my life for motivation. I once had someone interested in me (I think anyway lol) and I was the most motivated I had ever been in my whole life. If you're just alone, it's hard to say motivated IMO. I realize this is probably a flawed way of thinking, and I know that you shouldn't rely on other people, but I just feel like I need someone to give me that spark.
